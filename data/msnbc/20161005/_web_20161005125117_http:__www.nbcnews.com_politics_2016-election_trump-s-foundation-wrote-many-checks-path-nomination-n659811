There are laws prohibiting self-dealing that would bar these kinds of donations if they were solely for Trump's personal benefit, but there's nothing stopping Trump from donating to these groups as a charitable act — even if it does grease the wheels of his presidential bid along the way. </p> <p> <strong>Related: <a href="/web/20161005123913/http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/what-we-know-about-trump-foundation-controversies-n659011">What We Know About the Trump Foundation Controversies </a></strong> </p> <p> The donations are the latest window into a foundation that is already being investigated for possible wrongdoing: The New York Attorney general sent a cease-and-desist letter to the foundation last week, saying it didn't have the proper certification to solicit donations in the state.

Trump had flirted with a possible run for president in 2012. </p> <p> It felt like the natural step in the "beginning of a friendship" between the two, Smith said, adding there had been no hint of quid pro quo. </p> <p> Smith told NBC News that Trump invited him to a meeting at Trump Tower after he was quoted criticizing the real estate mogul in the press. Smith solicited a donation at the time, because "if you're meeting with Donald Trump and you don't ask for money, you're out of your mind," he said. He later received a $10,000 check from Trump's foundation. </p> <p> "He never seemed to try and call in a favor, never seemed to try and ask me to organize," Smith said. Four years later, in 2016, Trump was invited to speak at a Palmetto Family Council sponsored event just before the state's primary, but couldn't attend. </p> <p> While these friendships did not all pan out politically for Trump — Smith has continued to criticize the candidate, and Family Leader's Bob Vander Plaats endorsed rival Ted Cruz before the Iowa caucuses this year, though he did later rally around Trump — the relationships did appear to be part of Trump's overall effort to boost his political profile. Several donations coincided with speaking engagements that put Trump in front of the very early-voting state activists that he would need to impress if he ran. </p> <p> The Trump campaign did not return a request for comment. </p> <p> In 2013, the same year as his foundation's first donation to Iowa's Family Leader, Vander Plaats invited Trump to <a href="/web/20161005123913/http://www.nbcnews.com/news/other/iowa-donald-trump-warns-republicans-about-hillary-immigration-f6C10893666">speak at the group's leadership summit, </a>according to the mogul.

Franklin Graham is not endorsing a candidate, he was an early ally of Trump — and his charities reaped the benefits, too. </p> <p> <strong>Related: <a href="/web/20161005123913/http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-brilliant-businessman-tax-experts-say-otherwise-n659046">Trump a Brilliant Businessman?
