Well, he never said" that more nations should get nuclear weapons, Mike Pence fired back at Tim Kaine when pressed on Donald Trump's views on the topic or proliferation. </p> <p> Trump didn't exactly say he wanted more countries to get nuclear weapons, but flirted with it and came extremely close. Here's the exchange on CNN that Kaine is referring to. </p> <p> TRUMP At some point we have to say, you know what, we're better off if Japan protects itself against this maniac in North Korea, we're better off, frankly, if South Korea is going to start to protect itself, we have… </p> <p> COOPER:  Saudi Arabia, nuclear weapons? </p> <p> TRUMP:  Saudi Arabia, absolutely. </p> <p> COOPER:  You would be fine with them having nuclear weapons? </p> <p> TRUMP:  No, not nuclear weapons, but they have to protect themselves or they have to pay us. Here's the thing, with Japan, they have to pay us or we have to let them protect themselves. </p> <p> COOPER:  So if you said, Japan, yes, it's fine, you get nuclear weapons, South Korea, you as well, and Saudi Arabia says we want them, too? </p> <p> TRUMP:  Can I be honest with you?  It's going to happen, anyway.  It's going to happen anyway.  It's only a question of time.  They're going to start having them or we have to get rid of them entirely.  </p> <p> The exchange <a href="/web/20161005182528/http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2016/03/29/full-rush-transcript-donald-trump-cnn-milwaukee-republican-presidential-town-hall/">continues here</a>, and Trump waffles a bit, but overall Trump seems awfully close to embracing a world with a lot more nuclear weapons. </p> <p> Trump never said "many of them are good people," he said "some, I assume, are good people." </p> <p>In discussing the work of the Clinton Foundation, Mike Pence said "less than 10 cents on the dollar has gone to charitable causes, it has been a platform for the Clintons to travel the world, to have staff."</p> <p> Pence is absolutely wrong here:  80-90 percent of Clinton Foundation funding goes to program services, which <a href="/web/20161005182528/http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/25/reince-priebus/reince-priebus-false-claim-80-clinton-foundation-c/">our friends at PolitiFact</a> found is the best measure of charitable work while checking a similar claim two months ago. It is true that less than 10 percent of their funds go to third-party charities, because most of its money goes directly to their projects.  </p> <p>"No, we haven't" said Russian President Vladimir Putin is a great leader Pence claimed on Tuesday night, later insisting it's "absolutely inaccurate" for Kaine to say he and Trump have called Putin a strong leader.</p> <p> Pence said Putin is <a href="/web/20161005182528/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/08/mike-pence-says-its-inarguable-that-putin-is-a-stronger-leader-than-obama/">stronger than Obama</a>, and Trump has said Putin i<a href="/web/20161005182528/http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/28/politics/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-quotes/">s a great leader, among other praising remarks.</a> Neither said both, but the message is largely the same. </p> <p> </p> <p>"To be honest, if Donald Trump said all those things you said he said, in the way you said he said those things, he wouldn't have a fraction of the insults that Hillary Clinton leveled when she said half of our supporters were a basket of deplorables." -- Mike Pence</p> <p> Pence claimed Trump didn't say a long list of insults, but he did. </p> <p> Here's what Kaine said: "Donald Trump during his campaign has called Mexicans rapists and criminals.  He's called women dogs, pigs, slobs, disgusting… He attacked an Indiana-born federal judge and said he was unqualified to hear a federal lawsuit because his parents were Mexican.  He went after John McCain, a POW, and said he wasn't a hero because he was captured.  He said African-Americans are living in hell, and he perpetrated this outrageous and bigoted lie that President Obama is not a U.S. citizen."  </p> <p> Trump did say all those things. Did he say them all during the campaign? Nearly. </p> <p> Trump hasn't called women dogs, pigs, and slobs during his 15 month campaign.  But when asked about those remarks during a debate, he doubled down: "Only Rosie O'Donnell." </p> <p dir="ltr" lang="en">LIVE FACT-CHECK: Kaine said Nixon released his tax returns under audit, but Nixon didnâ€™t release them as a candidate <a href="/web/20161005182528/https://t.co/z26njxnAbG">https://t.co/z26njxnAbG</a> <a href="/web/20161005182528/https://t.co/Z9J0on27xg">pic.twitter.com/Z9J0on27xg</a></p> <p>"I have brilliantly used those laws.

Meanwhile, we're still working our way through his rambling Saturday attacks on Clinton that offered up numerous inaccuracies. </p> <p> Here's three big whoppers.  </p> <p>"Here's a woman who has given Barack Obama such bad advice that I guarantee you, if he had the choice to do all over again, go back years, he would have never picked her as Secretary of State. She's been a disaster, everything she's done has been bad. It's ended in huge financial lose and death. And I mean death on both sides, death on both sides.

The only time they turn the cameras - because they're dishonest as hell - and you know, they don't realize one thing….If they showed the kind of crowds we have, which people can hear. You know, it's interesting you can hear the crowds when you hear the television. But if they showed, it would be better television, but they don't know much about that. It would be better television." -Trump, 10/1/2016</p> <p> Press are confined to a campaign-designated "pen" during rallies which largely prevents media from getting the kind of shot Trump says they are withholding. Despite repeated requests by television networks, the campaign has declined to set up a riser from which to shoot cuts of the crowd. </p> <p> The campaign did recently lead pooled press to film the crowd in Melbourne, Florida, producing the below shot, but this is an exception to the rule.  </p> <p dir="ltr" lang="en">I know Trump says we don't show the crowd, but we did shoot this tonight b/c we were allowed to leave the pen. <a href="/web/20161005182528/https://t.co/F5EzOpiynv">pic.twitter.com/F5EzOpiynv</a></p> <p>"Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate?"

Trump attacked former Miss Universe Alicia Machado as "disgusting" in a series of early morning tweets Friday. </p> <p> But Clinton didn't say that during the first presidential debate. Here's what she said, according to a transcript. </p> <p>CLINTON: And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest. He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them. And he called this woman "Miss Piggy." Then he called her "Miss Housekeeping," because she was Latina. Donald, she has a name. </p> <p>TRUMP: Where did you find this? Where did you find this? </p> <p>CLINTON: Her name is Alicia Machado. </p> <p>TRUMP: Where did you find this?</p> <p>CLINTON: And she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet... </p> <p>TRUMP: Oh, really? CLINTON: ... she's going to vote this November. </p> <p> The only person declaring Machado's "virtue" relevant, or even discussing it here, is Trump. </p> <p dir="ltr" lang="en">Using Alicia M in the debate as a paragon of virtue just shows that Crooked Hillary suffers from BAD JUDGEMENT!

Hillary floated her as an "angel" without checking her past, which is terrible!</p> <p>"You saw what happened about taking the Fifth Amendment and her ringleaders getting immunity deals. We'll call them really the FBI immunity Five. Nobody's ever seen. They gave so much immunity there was nobody left to talk to. There was nobody left! Except Hillary. They probably gave her immunity too. Do you think Hillary got immunity? Yeah, she had the immunity. She had something." Trump, 9/29/2016</p> <p> Trump is right that five aides were given immunity by the FBI, but wrong to say Clinton had been given immunity or "something" during investigations into her use of a private server while serving as Secretary of State. </p> <p> FBI Director James Comey has repeatedly said the bureau did not recommend charging the former Secretary of State with a crime because "we didn't find any evil intent" that would have been necessary to make a case. </p> <p> "We cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts," Comey said when <a href="/web/20161005182528/https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/statement-by-fbi-director-james-b-comey-on-the-investigation-of-secretary-hillary-clinton2019s-use-of-a-personal-e-mail-system">announcing</a> his decision. </p> <p>"Google search engine was suppressing the bad news about Hillary Clinton. How about that? How about that?" Trump, 9/28/2016</p> <p> There's no evidence for this. A conspiracy theory has been floating around for months that Google's autocomplete function censors negative news about the Democratic nominee, but the search engine has denied it.  </p> <p> Though the company declined to offer a new statement when reached by NBC News late Wednesday, they said in June that "Google autocomplete does not favor any candidate or cause. Claims to the contrary simply misunderstand how autocomplete works."  </p> <p> There's little evidence supporting these accusations other than a handful of reports from conservative outlets with anecdotal or otherwise questionable sourcing behind them. Breitbart News, the conservative outlet run by Steve Bannon before he was hired by the Trump campaign, reported the theory in mid-September with Russian state-owned and operated news outlet <a href="/web/20161005182528/http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/09/13/hillary-google-bias-confirmed-experiment/">Sputnik as their source.</a> </p> <p> </p> <p>"You know, they wanted to fire her.

Donald Trump, 9/28/2016</p> <p> Trump said he'd won the debate in "every single poll that was taken" while citing a poll in which he lost the debate. </p> <p> Trump made this boast Wednesday evening on Fox News, a day after CNN/ORC released a poll showing that Clinton <a href="/web/20161005182528/http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/27/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-debate-poll/index.html">won the first debate,</a> and hours after an online NBC/SurveyMonkey poll said Clinton <a href="/web/20161005182528/http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/data-points/poll-majority-voters-say-clinton-won-first-presidential-debate-n656231">won as well.</a> He actually lost the first debate according to more respondents in the Google/International Journal Review online poll. </p> <p> That "2 or 3 point" margin win he's talking about? It's actually a 1.7 percent lead (within the margin of error) on the poll's second question, which asks respondents which candidate they support in the election overall.  </p> <p> Donald Trump is cherry picking his data here: While murder and non-negligent manslaughter did rise 14.5 percent in the nation's largest cities last year, and the single-year increase in crime is notable, 2015's violent crime numbers are still 16.5 percent lower than a decade ago and 1 percent lower than in 2011.  </p> <p> The candidate has repeatedly misled the public about crime before: In August, he said inner-city crime was at record levels. <a href="/web/20161005182528/http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/30/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-inner-city-crime-reaching-recor/">It's not.</a> </p> <p> NBC and PolitiFact published 20 fact checks for the first presidential debate<a href="/web/20161005182528/http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/2016-presidential-debates/31-fact-checks-first-presidential-debate-n655156"> in the wee hours of Tuesday morning</a>, but after<a href="/web/20161005182528/https://www.google.com/trends/story/US_cu_XRyhKlcBAACrtM_en"> new data from Google Trends</a> gave us a window into the questions Americans were asking during Monday's event, we wanted to offer up answers to those, too. </p> <p> <strong>Is stop and frisk unconstitutional?</strong> <a href="/web/20161005182528/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/13/nyregion/stop-and-frisk-practice-violated-rights-judge-rules.html">Yes. </a> </p> <p> <strong>How many shootings in Chicago?</strong> Trump is right to say there have been "thousands" of shootings in Chicago this year.

Roughly 17,000 of them were later recovered by the FBI, which found that many were work related.
