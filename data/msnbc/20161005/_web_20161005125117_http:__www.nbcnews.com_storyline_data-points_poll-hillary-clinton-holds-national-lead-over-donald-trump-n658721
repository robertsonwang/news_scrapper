Libertarian Gary Johnson is down slightly from last week with 9 percent and Green Party candidate Jill Stein holds steady with 3 percent. </p> <p> The poll was conducted online September 26 through October 2, 2016 among likely voters. </p> <p> In the two-way general-election match-up, Clinton leads Trump by 6 points, 50 percent to 44 percent. The margin is virtually unchanged from last week. </p> <p> Historically, in presidential years, women make up a larger share of the electorate than men. In 2012, for example, 53 percent of voters were women and 47 percent were men, according to NBC News Exit Poll results. </p> <p> Trump's campaign has needed to appeal to women voters in a big way and the past week—from his debate performance to his feud with former Miss Universe Alicia Machado and his reported sexist behavior during his reality TV years—has shown that he still has more work to do to secure women voters. </p> <p> Among women likely voters, a majority—52 percent—said they support Clinton compared to 34 percent who said they support Trump; 8 percent of women voters said they support Johnson and 3 percent said they support Stein. </p> <p> Taking a deeper look at women voters, an overwhelming majority of women who have never been married—67 percent—support Clinton. Only 18 percent of women who have never been married said they support Trump, 9 percent said they support Johnson and 4 percent said they support Stein. </p> <p> Among married women the margin narrows significantly: 48 percent said they support Clinton, 40 percent said Trump, 8 percent said they support Johnson and only 2 percent said they support Stein. </p> <p> Men who have never been married also said they support Clinton by a large margin—51 percent to 28 percent for Trump, 14 percent for Johnson and 6 percent for Stein. A majority of married men (52 percent), on the other hand, said they support Trump over Clinton with 35 percent, Johnson with 9 percent and Stein with 2 percent. </p> <p> A majority of women voters who do not have children (63 percent) said they support Clinton. Just under a quarter (23 percent) of women voters without children said they support Trump, 9 percent said they support Johnson and 4 percent said they support Stein. </p> <p> Women with children, however, were more split—50 percent of mothers said they support Clinton, 38 percent said they support Trump, 7 percent support Johnson and 3 percent support Stein. </p> <p> Men with children said they support Trump over the other candidates, 52 percent, to 35 percent for Clinton, 9 percent for Johnson and 2 percent for Stein. </p> <p> Forty-nine percent of men who do not have children said they support Clinton; 33 percent said they support Trump, 13 percent of men without children said they support Johnson and 4 percent said Stein. </p> <p> <em>The NBC News|SurveyMonkey Weekly Election Tracking poll was conducted online September 26 through October 2, 2016 among a national sample of 26,925 adults who are likely to vote.
