<p> The German city of Munich woke up to a state of emergency Saturday, the day after an <a href="/web/20160723094012/http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/shots-fired-munich-shopping-center-german-police-say-n615031">18-year-old shooter killed 9 in a shopping mall and then turned the gun on himself</a>, according to officials. </p> <p> Police were scouring the city for clues to explain why the German-Iranian opened fire at a McDonald's attached to the Olympia Einkaufszentrum shopping center Friday evening. The unnamed suspect had been living in the city for more than two years, Munich Police President Hubertus Andrae said. </p> <p> Andrae told a news conference early Saturday the motive for the shooting was "fully unclear." He added that it was too early to label it an act of terrorism, although police had used the term earlier to describe the nature of their operation, which included calling in the elite GSG9 special operations force. </p> <p> Peter Beck, a Munich police spokesman, said officers were still collecting evidence at the scene of the crime Saturday morning. </p> <p> "With regard to the suspect we have to examine everything, but we don't know yet what triggered the crime," Beck told The Associated Press. </p> <p dir="ltr" lang="en">The sad result of <a href="/web/20160723094012/https://twitter.com/hashtag/munich?src=hash">#munich</a> <a href="/web/20160723094012/https://twitter.com/hashtag/gunfire?src=hash">#gunfire</a><br>10 fatal casualties, among them the shooter<br>16 injured<br>For more see(german text):<a href="/web/20160723094012/https://t.co/ZooBf7NG6J">https://t.co/ZooBf7NG6J</a></br></br></br></p> <p> Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter cancelled all events and festivities in the city, saying in a tweet: "Today is a day of mourning, not celebration." </p> <p> As the attack unfolded Friday, authorities locked down the Bavarian capital, shutting down public transportation and warning residents to stay away from public places. Sixteen people were wounded — three critically, officials said. </p> <p> On Saturday, flags throughout the country flew at half staff while Germany's security cabinet got set to meet in Berlin at 12:30 p.m. (6:30 a.m. ET). German Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière cut short a trip to the U.S. to attend the gathering chaired by Chancellor Angela Merkel. </p> <p> Around 2,300 police in Germany and neighboring Austria were called on to response to the rampage, which happened less than a week after a 17-year-old Afghan asylum-seeker wounded five people in an ax-and-knife <a href="/web/20160723094012/http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/wuerzburg-train-attack-isis-flag-found-teen-attacker-s-room-n612156">rampage that started on a regional train near the Bavarian city of Wuerzburg</a>. ISIS claimed responsibility for the train attack, but authorities have said the teen — who was shot and killed by police — likely acted alone. </p>
