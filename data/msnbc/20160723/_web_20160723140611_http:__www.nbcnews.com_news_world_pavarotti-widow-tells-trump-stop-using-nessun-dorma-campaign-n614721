The piece ends with a repeat of the Italian word "Vincero" — "I will win." </p> <p dir="ltr" lang="en">With Nessun Dorma blasting out, Donald Trump’s plane flies right past media and cheering supporters in Cleveland. <a href="/web/20160723162437/https://t.co/fmwDpIVcjh">pic.twitter.com/fmwDpIVcjh</a></p> <p> Mantovani was married to the superstar tenor from 2003 until he died of pancreatic cancer in 2007 at age 71. </p> <p> On Friday, the estate of the late George Harrison complained at the "offensive" use of the Beatles' "Here Comes the Sun" at the convention. </p> <p dir="ltr" lang="en">If it had been Beware of Darkness, then we MAY have approved it! <a href="/web/20160723162437/https://twitter.com/hashtag/TrumpYourself?src=hash">#TrumpYourself</a></p> <p> The <a href="/web/20160723162437/http://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/music/rolling-stones-tell-donald-trump-stop-playing-their-music-rallies-n568581">Rolling Stones</a>, Adele and R.E.M and other artists requested Trump to stop using their music, too. </p> <p> Politicians don't have to get permission to use an artist's music if they buy "blanket licenses" from public-performance organizations ASCAP or BMI, which pay royalties to members, according to <a href="/web/20160723162437/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/04/arts/music/romney-and-gingrich-pull-songs-after-complaints.html">The New York Times</a>.
