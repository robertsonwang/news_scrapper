The dress is currently not available at the Nordstrom site nor at Macys.com. </p> <p dir="ltr" lang="en">Shop Ivanka's look from her <a href="/web/20160723165413/https://twitter.com/hashtag/RNC?src=hash">#RNC</a> speech: <a href="/web/20160723165413/https://t.co/ma42A92DYa">https://t.co/ma42A92DYa</a> <a href="/web/20160723165413/https://twitter.com/hashtag/RNCinCLE?src=hash">#RNCinCLE</a> <a href="/web/20160723165413/https://t.co/DwHvSOu8Ue">pic.twitter.com/DwHvSOu8Ue</a></p> <p> Although her speech at the convention was well received overall, the dress promotion was not. </p> <p> "Using your dad's presidential run to turn a buck. Classy," wrote one person on Twitter. </p> <p> While supporters of Donald Trump may enjoy the outfit's "classic crewneck" and "effortless look," not everyone may appreciate the fact that his daughter's fashion line is unlikely to "Make America Great Again." The department store site lists the Ivanka Trump Sleeveless Sheath Dress as "imported." </p>
