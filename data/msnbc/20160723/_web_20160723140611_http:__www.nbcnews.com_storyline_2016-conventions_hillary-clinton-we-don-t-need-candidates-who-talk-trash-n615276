<p> TAMPA, Fla. â€” Hillary Clinton made no mention of her potential running mate during a rally here Friday evening, instead delivering a fiery rebuttal to Donald Trump's acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention. </p> <p> "The last thing we need is somebody running for president who talks trash about America," Clinton said of the Republican nominee's lengthy address in Cleveland. </p> <p> Though she acknowledged the focus on her at the GOP convention in general was "kind of perversely flattering," she slammed Trump's two main messages: "I alone can fix this" and "I am your voice." </p> <p> Clinton accused Trump of offering a "dark and divisive vision" beyond what he's said in the past. "Last night's speech took it to a whole new level. He offered a lot of fear and anger. And resentment but no solutions about anything that he even talked about," she said. </p> <p> The presumptive Democratic nominee responded specifically to Trump's claim that "I alone can fix this" by saying implying he was a dictator. "That's not a democracy, my friends. As I recall, we had a revolution to make sure we didn't have someone who said, 'I can fix it alone,'" she said. </p> <p> Clinton also took issue with Trump's assertion that he speaks for most Americans. She went on a long list of groups she doesn't believe he represents, including: small business owners, housekeepers, cooks, immigrants, people with disabilities, veterans and women. </p> <p> She also applauded Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, of all people, for saying "vote your conscience" during his remarks at the RNC this week. </p> <p> "Something has gone terribly wrong when one speaker says 'vote your conscience' and gets booed," Clinton said. "I mean, I never thought I would say these words but: Ted Cruz was right. In this election, do the right thing and vote your conscience. Vote for your future." </p>
