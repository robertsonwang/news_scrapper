D'Souza conveniently never utters that phrase, flashing back instead to re-creations of scenes featuring Democrats beating slaves and putting on Klan hoods." </p> <p> And while "2016: Obama's America" certainly presented an ominous portrait of the 44th president, "Hillary's America" (which is also based on a D'Souza book, <a href="/web/20160723160233/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America:_Imagine_the_World_Without_Her">"America: Imagine the World Without Her"</a>) appears to be taking an even more overtly horror-genre route. </p> <p> <strong>Related:<a href="/web/20160723160233/http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/scholar-behind-anti-obama-film-dinesh-dsouza-gets-probation-n210066"> Scholar Behind Anti-Obama Film, Dinesh D'Souza, Gets Probation</a></strong> </p> <p> The poster for the new film even comes complete with a testimonial quote from legendary "Exorcist" author William Peter Blatty ("Utterly terrifying," it reads). </p> <p> "These alarmist partisan documentaries have a significantly greater opportunity to find a wider audience in a presidential election year," <a href="/web/20160723160233/https://twitter.com/danyloria?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank">Daniel Loria</a>, managing editor of <a href="/web/20160723160233/http://pro.boxoffice.com/" target="_blank">Pro.BoxOffice.com</a>, told NBC News on Friday. "Considering this has been a particularly acrimonious election cycle — especially with the sort of attacks being leveled at Hilary Clinton — it wouldn't surprise me if this movie picks up traction with older audiences that haven't been to the movies in a while." </p> <p> Not unlike its predecessor, D'Souza's latest has been savaged by critics — it currently averages a score of just 1 on <a href="/web/20160723160233/http://www.metacritic.com/movie/hillarys-america-the-secret-history-of-the-democratic-party">Metacritic</a> and has just a 5% positive rating on <a href="/web/20160723160233/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hillarys_america_the_secret_history_of_the_democratic_party/?search=hillary%27s%20america">Rotten Tomatoes</a>. </p> <p> "['Hillary's America'] is the cinematic equivalent of a drunk man at a sports bar sucking back whole jalapeño peppers hoping for applause without ever being dared," writes Jordan Hoffman for <a href="/web/20160723160233/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/18/hillarys-america-review-dinesh-dsouza-racist-democrat-super-villains"><em>The Guardian</em></a>, in one of the more charitable reviews. "The amusement in watching doesn't compensate for the pity one feels for someone so desperate for attention." </p> <p> It's true that the last few years have not been kind to the author-turned-documentation. In 2012, D'Souza was <a href="/web/20160723160233/http://thegrio.com/2012/10/18/obamas-america-filmmaker-dinesh-dsouza-resigns-from-ny-evangelical-college/">forced to step down</a> from his position as president of the faith-based <a href="/web/20160723160233/https://www.kings.edu/">King's College</a> in New York after he was accused of engaged in an extramarital affair. And in 2014, he was <a href="/web/20160723160233/http://thegrio.com/2014/01/23/anti-obama-filmmaker-dinesh-dsouza-charged-with-fraud/">sentenced to serve 8 months</a> in a halfway house after he was <a href="/web/20160723160233/http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/dinesh-dsouza-gets-5-years-probation">convicted of making illegal campaign contributions</a>, an episode which D'Souza dramatically re-enacts in his new film. </p> <p> <strong>Related: <a href="/web/20160723160233/http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/conservervative-obama-documentary-maker-dinesh-dsouza-accused-illegal-campaign-contributions-n15441">Dinesh D'Souza Accused of Illegal Campaign Contributions</a></strong> </p> <p> "It all began when the Obama administration tried to shut me up," he intones in the trailer. </p> <p> D'Souza and his attorneys have alleged that he's been a target for retribution from the White House ever since his conviction, but in recent years it is <em>he</em> who has been antagonizing the president — at least publicly. </p> <p> During the Ebola scare of 2014, D'Souza <a href="/web/20160723160233/http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/dinesh-dsouza-compares-ebola-outbreak-obamas-father">seized onto the moment</a> to take shots at the president's deceased father. "Which is a more dangerous infection: <a href="/web/20160723160233/https://m.facebook.com/hashtag/ebola">‪#‎Ebola‬</a>, or the dreams from his father?" he tweeted. He also directed fire at the healthy eating initiatives of first lady Michelle Obama: </p> <p dir="ltr" lang="en">Tell us, Michelle, will "healthy eating" protect us from the Ebola your husband allowed into this country? <a href="/web/20160723160233/http://t.co/cL4XIU20I7">http://t.co/cL4XIU20I7</a></p> <p> Even more incendiary was a <a href="/web/20160723160233/http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/dinesh-dsouza-latest-offensive-tweet-takes-aim-obama">racially offensive social media attack</a> he launched on the president the following year, after sharing an image of him with a selfie stick from a BuzzFeed video entitled, "Things Everybody Does But Doesn't Talk About": </p> <p dir="ltr" lang="en">YOU CAN TAKE THE BOY OUT OF THE GHETTO...Watch this vulgar man show his stuff, while America cowers in embarrassment <a href="/web/20160723160233/http://t.co/C9yLG4QoOK">pic.twitter.com/C9yLG4QoOK</a></p> <p> Following the backlash, D'Souza wrote: "TRANSLATING FOR OBAMA GROUPIES: A guy without class doesn't become a classy guy, even when he's in the White House." </p> <p> The firebrand's last attempt to derail a Democratic nominee was ultimately unsuccessful. After initially outperforming expectations, "2016: Obama's America" never appeared to catch on with audiences who were not already pre-disposed to oppose the president. Obama won re-election handily in the fall. And if Zilberman's review is indicative of how most mainstream audiences receive his latest, it may fail to influence voters as well. </p> <p> "By the time he gets around to attacking Clinton — with nothing that will seem new to the average viewer of Fox News — the film is more than half over," he writes. "D'Souza may wish to tilt the election, but he'll be lucky if his fans can make it through his film without falling asleep." </p>
