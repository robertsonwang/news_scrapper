<p> In the last 24 hours, one national poll showed Hillary Clinton with a <a href="/web/20161028092412/http://ap-gfkpoll.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/October-2016-AP-GfK-Poll-Topline_Campaign.pdf">14-point lead</a>. Another had her ahead by <a href="/web/20161028092412/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/10/26/fox-news-poll-clinton-leads-trump-by-three-points.html">just three points</a>. And another found it right in the middle -- Clinton up <a href="/web/20161028092412/http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/editorialfiles/2016/10/27/survey.pdf">nine points</a>. </p> <p> In the battleground states, meanwhile, one survey had Clinton leading in New Hampshire by <a href="/web/20161028092412/http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/polls-clinton-holds-9-point-lead-new-hampshire-tied-nevada-n673361">nine points</a> while another one had her up <a href="/web/20161028092412/https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/MonmouthPoll_NH_102616/">four</a> in the Granite State. Then there was that recent Florida poll that found Donald Trump ahead <a href="/web/20161028092412/http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-10-26/florida-poll">by two</a>. </p> <p> How to make sense of the plethora of polls? Well, here's an answer: Clinton is clearly ahead, though the margin is larger in some polls than others. </p> <p> And when looking at the battleground states, she still has the easiest path to the 270 electoral votes. </p> <p> Looking at the national polls, the Huffington Post shows Clinton with an average lead of <a href="/web/20161028092412/http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-general-election-trump-vs-clinton">seven points</a> in the surveys it recognizes, while the RealClearPolitics average has it at <a href="/web/20161028092412/http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson_vs_stein-5952.html">five points</a>. </p> <p> To put those numbers into perspective, President Obama won the national vote by seven percentage points in 2008 and by four points in 2012. </p> <p> What's more, on this same day in the 2012 cycle, Obama held just a <a href="/web/20161028092412/http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2012-general-election-romney-vs-obama">0.6-point lead</a> over Mitt Romney in the Huffington Post poll tracker. </p> <p> Turning to the state polls, Clinton continues to enjoy healthy leads in Pennsylvania and New Hampshire - which, according to NBC's battleground map, puts her above the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. </p> <p> And as for Florida, Clinton holds nearly a 2-point lead from the average of polls in the state. In fact, of the polls that NBC News recognizes, Trump has led in just <a href="/web/20161028092412/http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/fl/florida_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson_vs_stein-5963.html">one Florida poll since the first presidential debate</a>. </p> <p> And a little reality check on the Sunshine State: It's a must-win state for Trump, while Clinton can cross 270 electoral votes without it. </p>
