It Is On !</p> <p> Race riots, nuclear detonation, political retaliation - those are some of the things that respondents of a new poll said could happen if Donald Trump is elected president.  </p> <p> The poll, commissioned by the Lincoln Leadership Initiative, a coalition of anti-Trump Republicans, and conducted by Survey Monkey, asked 1,051 registered voters the likelihood a scenario would take place.  </p> <p> The respondents were asked to rate on a scale of 0 to 100 the likelihood of a scenario under a Trump administration with 100 being the most likely and 0 being the least likely. The respondents said:  </p> <p> - 65 percent chance of race riots </p> <p> - 65 percent chance Trump would use the power of his office against political opponents </p> <p> - 54 percent chance the U.S. government would default on its debt </p> <p> - 54 percent chance of a database to track Muslims </p> <p> - 46 percent chance that Trump would use a nuclear weapon against a foreign enemy </p> <p> Andrew Weinstein, co-founder of LLI and former adviser to House Speaker Newt Gingrich, said there has been little analysis of a possible Trump presidency.  </p> <p> "We thought it might be useful to learn a little more about what the American people thought a trump presidency would bring," Weinstein said.   </p> <p> Voters hoping for a meet-and-greet with President Josiah Bartlett (Martin Sheen) may be disappointed.

In 2014, President Obama also appeared on the show to promote the Affordable Care Act and the video went viral. </p>
