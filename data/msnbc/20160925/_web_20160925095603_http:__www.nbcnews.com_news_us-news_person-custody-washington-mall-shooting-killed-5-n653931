<p> A 20-year-old suspected gunman was arrested Saturday in connection with a shooting at a Washington state mall the night before that left five people dead, authorities said. </p> <p> Arcan Cetin was arrested in Oak Harbor at around 6:30 p.m. while walking down the street as authorities converged on a car believed used in the shooting at the Cascade Mall in Burlington, police said at a press conference. </p> <p> "He said nothing. He was just kind of zombie-like, about the best I can describe," said Island County sheriff's Lt. Mike Hawley, who was headed to a car suspected in the shooting Saturday, recognized Cetin, and made a quick turn and arrested him without incident. </p> <p> A motive in the shooting is still under investigation, Mount Vernon police Lt. Chris Cammock, part of a multi-agency task force, said at a news conference Saturday night. </p> <p> Four female victims were pronounced dead Friday night while a male victim who was wounded in the shooting was taken to a hospital where he died overnight, authorities said. The victims' names and ages have not been released. </p> <p> Asked whether authorities were considering terrorism as a possible motive, Cammock said he wasn't ruling anything out, but he cautioned that "it's just too early to tell" a motive and his response doesn't mean the investigation is going in that direction. </p> <p> Officials have said previously it appears the gunman acted alone and they have no indication it was terrorism. </p> <p> Investigators believe Cetin escaped the mall in a car, touching off a manhunt that stretched for nearly 24 hours before he was arrested in Oak Harbor, Cammock said. While the gunman was on the loose, authorities cautioned residents to be vigilant and to stay indoors. </p> <p> Police received numerous tips, and one of those tips received earlier Saturday led police to begin looking into Cetin, Cammock said. </p> <p> Surveillance video from other businesses and elsewhere in the city led authorities to identify the vehicle, Cammock said. </p> <p> Security footage showed the man entering the mall, apparently without a weapon. In additional footage from about 10 minutes later, he "entered Macy's with a rifle and fired multiple times," Cammock said earlier. </p> <p> Cammock said Saturday night that authorities believe he kept the rifle, which was recovered at the scene, in the car and retrieved it before the shooting. Police were tracing ownership of the weapon, he said. </p> <p> Joe Zavala of Blaine, Washington, was drinking coffee outside of Macy's while his wife was in the store when he heard shots ring out. </p> <p> "Then I saw a man pointing a gun and shooting people," Zavala <a href="/web/20160925072738/http://www.king5.com/news/local/five-people-dead-in-cascade-mall-shooting-in-burlington/324940198">told NBC affiliate KING 5 in Seattle</a>. "And then I got up to look a little closer and he saw me, pointed the gun, and I took off running." </p> <p> Once the shots stopped Zavala ran back to the store and saw people lying on the floor and and a rifle placed on top of the cosmetics counter. He eventually found his wife inside a fitting room. </p> <p> When Cetin was arrested Saturday he was unarmed, Hawley said. Hawley said when he and a reserve deputy got out of their cars with guns drawn Cetin "just froze" and obeyed commands. </p> <p> Cetin has not yet been formally charged, but will be held at the Skagit County Jail under an investigative hold while prosecutors review the case, Cammock said. When Cetin was arrested he was unarmed, Hawley said. </p> <p> Cetin is an immigrant from Turkey but is a legal permanent resident of the United States and lives in Oak Harbor, Cammock said. Cetin did not know when he came to the U.S. He was arrested in Island County last year on a case of simple assault, Hawley said. Cammock said investigators are in touch with Cetin's family and police have a good working relationship with them. </p> <p> Why Cetin carried out the shooting and why he chose Macy's is still unclear, Cammock said. "We're only about a couple hours from taking him into custody, and the next stage right now is to do those interviews and learn more from him, if he's willing to share that with us," Cammock said. </p> <p> Washington Gov. Jay Inslee praised law enforcement and said the entire state stands with the community of Burlington. "All of our hearts are in Burlington tonight," he said. </p> <p> Burlington Mayor Steve Sexton called the shooting "an attack on our community." </p> <p> "We suffered a devastating loss of five treasured members of our community, who had done nothing more than what we all have done on any given day â€” gone to the shopping mall," Sexton said. "That was us in that mall last night. Any one of us at any given time." </p> <p> Earlier Saturday, dozens of people attended a prayer service for the victims of the deadly mall shooting. </p> <p> The Saturday evening gathering was held at Central United Methodist Church in Sedro-Woolley, Washington. The Rev. Cody Natland lit five candles on a table in front of the church, one for each victim. </p>
