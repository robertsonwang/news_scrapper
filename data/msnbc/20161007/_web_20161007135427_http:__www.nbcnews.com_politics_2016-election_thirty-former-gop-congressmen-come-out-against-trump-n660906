Tom Coleman of Missouri, but nearly half of the signatories are doing so for the first time. </p> <p> "At some point you have to put country over party," said Coleman. "I think he's dangerous. I think he is mentally and emotionally unfit to be president." </p> <p> One of the signatories, Rep. Bill Clinger of Pennsylvania, oversaw the House Government and Oversight Reform Committee, which investigated former president Bill Clinton's administration for <a href="/web/20161007121942/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_FBI_files_controversy">Filegate</a> and <a href="/web/20161007121942/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_travel_office_controversy">Travelgate</a>. </p> <p> "(To) the people in the Republican Party who are saying you need to fall in line - don't try to persuade us. This guy has real personal problems and we don't want somebody like him in office," said former Rep. Mickey Edwards of Oklahoma. </p> <p> But will the members vote for Democrat Hillary Clinton? "I don't know," Coleman said. </p> <p> "It's not about voting for somebody. We left it open for people to support Mrs. Clinton - that's fine or they vote third party or some don't want to vote at all," he added. </p> <p> Here's a list of signatories: </p> <p> Steve Bartlett (R-TX) </p> <p> Bob Bauman (R-MD) </p> <p> Sherwood Boehlert (R-NY) </p> <p> Jack Buechner (R-MO) </p> <p> Tom Campbell (R-CA) </p> <p> Bill Clinger (R-PA) </p> <p> Tom Coleman (R-MO) </p> <p> Geoff Davis (R-KY) </p> <p> Mickey Edwards (R-OK) </p> <p> Harris Fawell (R-IL) </p> <p> Ed Foreman (R-TX) (R-NM) </p> <p> Amo Houghton, Jr. (R-NY) </p> <p> Gordon Humphrey (Senator, R-NH) </p> <p> Bob Inglis (R-SC) </p> <p> Jim Kolbe (R-AZ) </p> <p> Steve Kuykendall (R-CA) </p> <p> Jim Leach (R-IA) </p> <p> Pete McCloskey (R-CA) </p> <p> Connie Morella (R-MD) </p> <p> Mike Parker (R-MS) </p> <p> Tom Petri (R-WI) </p> <p> John Porter (R-IL) </p> <p> Claudine Schneider (R-RI) </p> <p> John "Joe" Schwarz (R-MI) </p> <p> Chris Shays (R-CT) </p> <p> Peter Smith (R-VT) </p> <p> Edward Weber (R-OH) </p> <p> Vin Weber (R-MN) </p> <p> G.
