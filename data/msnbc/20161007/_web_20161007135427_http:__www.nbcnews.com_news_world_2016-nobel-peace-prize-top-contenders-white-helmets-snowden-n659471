The quartet claimed the prize<a href="/web/20161007172332/http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/merkel-eritrean-priest-top-nobel-peace-prize-contenders-n440191"> over more well-known names</a>. </p> <p> The Nobel Committee doesn't release much information beforehand but, as a helpful guide, the unaffiliated Peace Research Institute Oslo releases its own list of potential winners. </p> <p> Major world events — such as the European migrant crisis and the Syrian civil war — will likely once again shape the Nobel Committee's decision, said PRIO director Kristian Berg Harpviken. </p> <p> "The challenge is to find a worthy candidate, preferably one that will also be an efficient ambassador for the prize," Harpviken told NBC News. </p> <p> Here are this year's likely front-runners, according to his group: </p> <p> The Russian mathematician has previously been floated as a Nobel favorite. </p> <p> As a human rights activist, Gannushkina became a prominent voice in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict of the 1980s, in which she advocated for freeing hundreds of Azerbaijani and Armenian prisoners of war. </p> <p> Last year, she criticized the Kremlin for sowing "mistrust" between the Russian people and the government, as well as of <a href="/web/20161007172332/http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-labels-u-s-s-national-endowment-democracy-undesirable-under-n399756">foreign nongovernmental organizations operating in the country</a>. </p> <p> Gannushkina has "a long record as an advocate for human rights, democracy and historical reconciliation in Russia and its neighborhood," Harpviken said, "and a prize to her would also draw attention to the worrying political developments taking place under President Putin." </p> <p> Moniz, the U.S. energy secretary, and Salehi, the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, were key players in hammering out the nuclear deal between Iran and the West. </p> <p> President Barack Obama and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani praised the agreement, and earlier this year, a historic moment occurred when international sanctions on Iran <a href="/web/20161007172332/http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/iran-nuclear-talks/nuclear-sanctions-be-lifted-iran-fm-zarif-n497861">were lifted after the United Nations declared Tehran fulfilled its commitment</a> to scale back its nuclear program. </p> <p> "Peace agreements are always prime candidates, yet no peace treaty has been awarded the prize since 1998, when John Hume and David Trimble were rewarded for their efforts to bring peace to Northern Ireland," Harpviken said. </p> <p> This fragile deal is important, he added, because it "prevents the escalation into violence and promotes nuclear disarmament" — a foundation for peace. </p> <p> The Syrian Civil Defense, a volunteer corps of first responders known for wearing white helmets, were recognized last month with the Right to Livelihood Award after reportedly rescuing more than 60,000 lives since the country erupted into a civil war in 2011. </p> <p> The award is often referred to as the "Alternative Nobel Prize." (Gannushkina was named a co-recipient this year as well.) Organizers cited the White Helmets' "deep commitment to humanitarian action" for drawing attention to the plight caused by the ongoing airstrikes. </p> <p> The group was also featured in a namesake <a href="/web/20161007172332/http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/netflix-s-white-helmets-highlights-syrian-rescue-group-front-line-n648886">Netflix documentary</a> released in September and were hailed for helping a 5-year-old boy covered in dust and blood in a <a href="/web/20161007172332/http://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/chilling-photo-of-bloodied-syrian-boy-shows-horrors-of-syria-746925123597">now-iconic image</a> from the war. </p> <p> The former NSA whistleblower remains a divisive figure after leaking a trove of classified U.S. security information in 2013. </p> <p> Snowden's supporters have described him as a patriot who helped shed light on government spying and asked Obama last month to pardon him. But a <a href="/web/20161007172332/http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/house-committee-blasts-edward-snowden-n649146">blistering House intelligence committee report </a>condemned him, saying the "public narrative popularized by Snowden and his allies is rife with falsehoods, exaggerations, and crucial omissions." </p> <p> A year ago this month, the <a href="/web/20161007172332/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/edward-snowden-eu-parliament-votes-to-drop-any-criminal-charges-against-whistle-blower-a6713771.html" target="_blank">EU parliament passed a vote </a>where it called on its members to "drop any criminal charges" against Snowden "in recognition of his status as a whistle-blower and international human rights defender." </p> <p> Snowden has remained in exile in Russia as he faces espionage charges in the U.S. </p> <p> The three are known for their work in the Congo, which was plunged into two major wars after millions of refugees fled a genocide in neighboring Rwanda in 1994.
