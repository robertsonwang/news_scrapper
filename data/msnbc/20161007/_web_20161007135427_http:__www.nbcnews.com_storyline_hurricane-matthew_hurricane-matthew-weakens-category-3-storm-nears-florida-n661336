Rick Scott warned would be "catastrophic." </p> <p> "There is no reason not to leave," Scott grimly warned as the storm, which killed at least 128 people across the Caribbean, moved ever closer. </p> <p> "Do not surf. Do not go to the beach," he said. "This storm will kill you." </p> <p> <strong>Latest developments</strong>: </p> <p> "This is like no storm in the record books," said Bryan Norcross, senior hurricane specialist for <a href="/web/20161007153026/http://www.weather.com/">The Weather Channel</a>, who predicted "a heartbreaking loss of life." </p> <p> "This is not hype, this is not hyperbole, and I am not kidding," Norcross said. "I cannot overstate the danger of this storm. Central and northern Florida have never been hit by a hurricane this strong." </p> <p dir="ltr" lang="en">You can see how close <a href="/web/20161007153026/https://twitter.com/hashtag/Matthew?src=hash">#Matthew</a> center is to the coast.<br>Expect hurricane gusts into the space coast <a href="/web/20161007153026/https://t.co/zXTkapdVpM">pic.twitter.com/zXTkapdVpM</a></br></p> <p> At 6 a.m. ET, the National Hurricane Center said Matthew was 25 miles east of Cape Canaveral, Fla., with top sustained winds of 120 mph. The center of the storm was heading for Florida at 14 mph. A gusts of up to 100 mph was recorded. </p> <p> It added: "Although weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours, Matthew is expected to be a category 3 hurricane as it moves near the coast of Florida today." </p> <p dir="ltr" lang="en">Extreme wind warning issued for Cape Canaveral which could see 115 mph gusts in the eyewall of <a href="/web/20161007153026/https://twitter.com/hashtag/Matthew?src=hash">#Matthew</a> <a href="/web/20161007153026/https://t.co/5FkbgGhyar">pic.twitter.com/5FkbgGhyar</a></p> <p> The National Weather Service said <a href="/web/20161007153026/http://www.nbcnews.com/card/matthew-weakens-storm-surge-threat-remains-n661546">Matthew's storm surge</a> — the rush of water driven to shore by wind and low atmospheric pressure — could be much stronger than the barrage that swamped the New Jersey shore during Superstorm Sandy in October 2012. </p> <p> "A good chunk of the east Florida coast — at least right along the coast — is going to be under water because of storm surge before too long," Ari Sarsalari, a meteorologist for The Weather Channel, said Thursday night. </p> <p> In addition, "wind damage will be extensive," Sarsalari said. "If you're trying to ride this one out, you're probably going to be without power for a very long time." </p> <p> The Weather Channel reported that electric utilities said more than 340,000 customers were without power early Friday. </p> <p> The Melbourne office of the National Weather Service warned of "devastating to catastrophic" impacts, with complete roof and wall failures and total destruction of mobile homes. </p> <p> <strong>LIVE BLOG: <a href="/web/20161007153026/http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/hurricane-matthew">The Latest on Hurricane Matthew</a></strong> </p> <p> "Locations may be uninhabitable for weeks or months," it said. </p> <p> If it makes landfall, Matthew would be the first major hurricane — category 3 or higher — to hit the U.S. mainland since Wilma in 2005. </p> <p dir="ltr" lang="en">Outer eye about 50 miles wide <a href="/web/20161007153026/https://t.co/GW0gWUC64z">pic.twitter.com/GW0gWUC64z</a></p> <p> Evacuations were also under way in Georgia and South Carolina after Matthew, which hammered Haiti and strafed Cuba, began <a href="/web/20161007153026/http://www.nbcnews.com/news/weather/strengthening-hurricane-matthew-could-be-devastating-bahamas-n660671">battering the Bahamas</a>.

Nikki Haley said bluntly at a news conference Thursday night, adding: "Now is the time for the state to pray." </p> <p> Beaufort Memorial Hospital in Beaufort, S.C., closed its emergency room and began evacuating its 62 patients Thursday. Patients were being sent to hospitals in Georgia and more western parts of South Carolina, it said. </p> <p> On Pawleys Island off the South Carolina coast, police were making residents who refused to evacuate sign a waiver with contact information for their next of kin, <a href="/web/20161007153026/http://www.wmbfnews.com/story/33335068/pawleys-island-residents-who-refuse-to-evacuate-asked-to-sign-waiver">NBC station WMBF</a> of Myrtle Beach reported. </p> <p> The projected path of the storm at 11 p.m. ET, according to the NHC: </p> <p> About 1.5 million people up and down Florida's east coast were ordered to evacuate, and 3,500 members of the National Guard — half the state's contingent — had been activated. </p> <p> In South Carolina, more than 280,000 people had been evacuated from historic Charleston and other coastal areas by early Thursday evening, Haley said — packing westbound traffic on Interstate 26 as motorists headed west. The exodus continued on Thursday as Haley ordered the evacuation of the low-lying Jasper and Colleton county areas. </p> <p> While most of the evacuees exhibited remarkable patience, police said one man frustrated by the bumper-to-bumper traffic opened fire Wednesday night at Moncks Corner police in Berkeley County. </p> <p> Lucas Felkel, 35, was wounded when a deputy fired back. He later died at Trident Medical Center, the county sheriff's office said. No officers or deputies were injured. </p> <p> In North Carolina, Gov. Pat McCrory declared a state of emergency in all 100 of the state's counties. Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency and ordered mandatory evacuations of about 500,000 people in six coastal counties. </p> <p dir="ltr" lang="en">Hurricane <a href="/web/20161007153026/https://twitter.com/hashtag/Matthew?src=hash">#Matthew</a>'s Accumulated Cyclone Energy is now the most by any Atlantic hurricane in over a decade (Ivan-2004). <a href="/web/20161007153026/https://t.co/RA4sqVZVWz">pic.twitter.com/RA4sqVZVWz</a></p>
