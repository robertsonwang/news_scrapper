The family spent the night with a few hundred fellow guests in a conference room, where they slept on blankets, pillows and foam pads the hotel gave them. </p> <p> "There was lots of snoring, lots of coughing and lots of babies crying," Schmitt told NBC News. </p> <p> Schmitt told NBC News she was "pretty panicked" when the flights to get off the island were cancelled. </p> <p> Eventually, though, she had accepted they were stuck for the time being. </p> <p> "I can't panic because I think it would cause my daughter to get upset. I'm telling her everything will be just fine," she said on the telephone. </p> <p> <strong>Related: <a href="/web/20161007135849/http://www.nbcnews.com/news/weather/hurricane-matthew-fleeing-residents-find-empty-shelves-lines-gas-n660116">Thousands of Americans Head Inland to Escape Hurricane Matthew</a></strong> </p> <p> Tropical storm systems typically weaken as they interact with land, but Matthew has so far refused to slow significantly — not when it slammed first into Haiti over a sparsely populated area of Cuba. </p> <p> "Matthew is likely to produce devastating impacts from storm surge, extreme winds and heavy rains in the Bahamas," the National Hurricane Center predicted. </p> <p> The projected path of the storm, according to the National Hurricane Center: </p> <p dir="ltr" lang="en">Waking to a strengthening <a href="/web/20161007135849/https://twitter.com/hashtag/Matthew?src=hash">#Matthew</a> and models that are converging on worst case for Florida's East Coast, GA and SC. <a href="/web/20161007135849/https://t.co/3zPrX8q4ZZ">pic.twitter.com/3zPrX8q4ZZ</a></p> <p> Residents in low-lying areas of southern New Providence were "strongly advised" Wednesday night to evacuate because of potential severe flooding, the National Emergency Management Agency said. </p> <p> A "controlled shutdown" of electricity was planned for New Providence, <a href="/web/20161007135849/https://www.facebook.com/mybec242/posts/1016139555175944">Bahamas Power &amp; Light said</a>, adding: "Most customers will have their supply interrupted at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday." </p> <p> "We will have to prepare for a worst-case scenario with respect to the impact of Hurricane Matthew," Prime Minister Perry Christie said, according to <a href="thenassauguardian.com/news/68322">The Nassau Guardian</a>. </p> <p> The U.S. Agency for International Development said Wednesday that it would direct $1.5 million in assistance to the storm-struck Caribbean.
