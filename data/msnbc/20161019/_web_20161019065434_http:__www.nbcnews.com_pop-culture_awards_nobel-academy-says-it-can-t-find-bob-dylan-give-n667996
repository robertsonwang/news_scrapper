<p> Bob Dylan, Nobel laureate, is missing. </p> <p> That, at least, is what the academy that honored him with the <a href="/web/20161018183620/http://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/music/bob-dylan-wins-nobel-prize-literature-n665591">most prestigious literature prize</a> on the planet last week <a href="/web/20161018183620/http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=4916&amp;artikel=6542352">told</a> Sweden's state-run radio SR on Monday. </p> <p> The academy's permanent secretary, Sara Danius, said she had emailed and called Dylan's "closest collaborator" to ensure he gets his hefty award of $927,740, <a href="/web/20161018183620/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/17/nobel-prize-bob-dylan-unable-to-reach">according to a translation published in The Guardian</a>. </p> <p> So far, she said, she's received "very friendly replies," according to The Guardian â€” but Dylan is still nowhere to be found. </p> <p> Which leaves the academy in the odd position of giving up on tracking down their laureate. </p> <p> "For now, that is certainly enough," Danius said, adding: "I am not at all worried. ... I think he will show up." </p>
