<p> The most powerful Atlantic tropical storm in almost a decade was coming ashore early Tuesday in Haiti, potentially <a href="/web/20161004100456/http://www.nbcnews.com/news/weather/humanitarian-disaster-haiti-s-forlorn-history-suggests-matthew-could-be-n658941">delivering yet another devastating humanitarian disaster</a> to the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere. </p> <p> As of 5 a.m. ET, Hurricane Matthew was a Category 4 storm with maximum sustained winds of 145 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. </p> <p dir="ltr" lang="en">Northern eyewall of <a href="/web/20161004100456/https://twitter.com/hashtag/Matthew?src=hash">#Matthew</a> now pushing into Tiburon Peninsula of <a href="/web/20161004100456/https://twitter.com/hashtag/Haiti?src=hash">#Haiti</a>.

In the eye-wall right now, 145 mph winds and likely storm surge of 10 feet covering portions of the city. <a href="/web/20161004100456/https://t.co/oyWeXHTZYA">pic.twitter.com/oyWeXHTZYA</a></p> <p> The storm is later expected to move on to Cuba, which forecasters said can expect between 8 and 12 inches of rain for most areas, with as much as 20 inches in isolated areas. </p> <p> The National Hurricane Center warned of storm surges of up to 11 feet were possible on Cuba's southern coast. </p> <p> A hurricane warning was also for issued for parts of the Bahamas early Tuesday. A storm surge of 10 - 15 feet was predicted there. </p> <p> Matthew is the most powerful Atlantic storm since 2007 and could make landfall in the U.S. later this week. </p> <p> "Unfortunately, the models continue to show a westward trend," Roth said early Tuesday. "That means the potential for a landfall or some impacts in the U.S. is increasing." </p> <p> The area most at risk of being affected by Matthew is the southeastern coast, anywhere from Florida up through North Carolina. Both Florida Gov. Rick Scott and North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory activated states of emergency on Monday, covering 66 counties in North Carolina and all counties in Florida. </p> <p> "Right now, the projected path is a little off the coast, but it can change at a moment's notice," Scott said at a news conference Monday. "When that happens, we're not going to have a lot of time to get ready." </p> <p> Karins warned that Tuesday was a "very important preparation day for all of the southeast coast" of the U.S. </p> <p> He added: "The possibility exists for mandatory evacuations starting as early as late this evening in South Florida and definitely Wednesday for southern half of Florida on the east coast ... With an expected path right along the Florida's east coast Matthew could be the biggest mass evacuation of coastal Florida since Floyd in 1999. And just like Floyd, it is not guaranteed that Matthew's eye will make landfall in Florida but it will be a close call." </p> <p dir="ltr" lang="en">In 99' Floyd triggered the 3rd largest evacuation in US history, 2.6 million coastal residents of 5 states were ordered from their homes.</p> <p dir="ltr" lang="en">Florida: Floyd was expected to hit as Cat 4, millions evacuated but storm stayed 100 mi offshore. <a href="/web/20161004100456/https://twitter.com/hashtag/Matthew?src=hash">#Matthew</a> forecast 50 mi offshore as Cat 3 <a href="/web/20161004100456/https://t.co/eX4GVsecE8">pic.twitter.com/eX4GVsecE8</a></p> <p> Karins predicted that Matthew would remain a Category 3 or 4 hurricane by the time it neared Florida on Thursday and likely would be a Category 2 or 3 when it reaches Georgia and North Carolina on Friday. </p> <p> When hurricanes are particularly deadly or destructive, the names are<a href="/web/20161004100456/http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutnames_history.shtml"> retired</a>. Meteorologists expect this to be the last hurricane named Matthew. </p> <p> "Certainly, the way this one is going, even if it doesn't hit the U.S. directly … I would say this is the last Matthew," Roth said. </p> <p dir="ltr" lang="en">Odds of this being the last hurricane ever named Matthew increased greatly in the last 24 hours.
