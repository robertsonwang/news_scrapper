<div class="zn-body__paragraph">Over the past 60 years, North Korea's leaders have attempted to incite tensions around the time of American elections -- especially in recent years, the study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies says. </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">For example, North Korea conducted a missile test and then a nuclear test shortly after President Barack Obama was elected.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">"Doing a major test would be a way of trying to intimidate the incoming president," said Victor Cha, one of the study's authors. "North Korea chooses particular windows that they know will gain maxmum attention from the world, and the US in particular."</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">"It could be a sixth nuclear test, it could be launching of their rocket which put a satellite in orbit," Cha added.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">The study is scheduled to be published this week <a href="/web/20161004094141/http://beyondparallel.csis.org/" target="_blank">on the CSIS website Beyond Parallel</a>.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">But some analysts see a shift in North Korea's provocations, from symbolic actions to concrete military tests, since Kim Jong Un took power after his father's death in 2011. These analysts see a decrease in deadly provocations that are primarily symbolic, such as the 2010 shelling of the disputed South Korean island Yeonpyeong, or the 2010 sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan with a torpedo. </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Only one has occurred recently -- the placing of land mines in the demilitarized zone, which injured two South Korean soldiers last year.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">"Nothing as aggressive as we saw under his father," said Ken Gause, who analyzes North Korea's leaders for CNA Corp. "Kim Jong Un, with the exception of the August crisis of last year, he has pretty much restricted his provocations to missile tests, nuclear tests, and cyber attacks."</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">The past few years have seen an exponential jump in the<a href="/web/20161004094141/http://38north.org/2016/08/missiletimeline082416/" target="_blank"> number of North Korean weapons development tests</a>, according to statistics from 38North, including 15 missile tests in 2016 alone. </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Any provocations carry an increased risk of escalation these days, analysts say, for two reasons.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">First, the South Korean government after 2010 made it easier for military commanders to respond to a provocation without waiting for politicians to consider a response.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">"They are more likely to retaliate earlier than in the past; they are also more likely to respond exponentially," said former CIA analyst Bruce Klingner, now with The Heritage Foundation.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">And second, Klingner said, the North's growing nuclear capability could give North Korean leaders a sense of impunity.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">"They may feel more emboldened conducting not only provocations, but actual attacks," he said, "feeling that they have immunity from any kind of US response, because North Korea has a nuclear deterrent to the US nuclear umbrella."</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">North Korea is one of the most difficult national security challenges the next president will face, according to CIA director John Brennan. </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Asked to identify America's biggest risk across the globe, he told CNN's Erin Burnett last week: "Kim Jong Un's nuclear arsenal missile capability. Not just to threaten his neighbors, but also to have intercontinental capability. That's something that the new team and the current team is looking at very, very closely and will need to be able to address."</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">But, national security analysts say, the US appears to have little leverage to stop the country's nuclear program from racing ahead.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">"I don't think we can solve it diplomatically, that much is clear. Every administration in the last 20 years has tried a diplomatic approach, and the North Koreans have blown through every one," said CSIS's Michael Green, who himself handled such efforts when he was director for Asian affairs at the National Security Council. </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">"What the US can do, with allies and partners -- and hopefully China -- is constrict North Korea's access to technology, to money, slow down their nuclear program, and start setting the stage for negotiations," he said.</div>
