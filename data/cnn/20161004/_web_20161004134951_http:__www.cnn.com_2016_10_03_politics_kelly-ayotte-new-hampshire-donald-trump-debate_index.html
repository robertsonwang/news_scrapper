Would you point to him as a role model?" </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">"I think that certainly there are many role models that we have, and I believe he can serve as president and so, absolutely. I would do that," she said at the <a href="/web/20161004093028/http://www.necn.com/news/politics/necn-to-Host-NH-Senate-Governor-Debates-395263641.html" target="_blank">New England College hosted debate in Henniker, New Hampshire</a>.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">In a statement afterward, Ayotte said: "I misspoke tonight. While I would hope all of our children would aspire to be president, neither Donald Trump nor Hillary Clinton have set a good example and I wouldn't hold either of them as role models for my kids."</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Ayotte is currently locked in a hotly contested Senate reelection race against Democratic rival, Gov.

"And I've been quite clear about those disagreements. And this is an area where Gov. Hassan has been lockstep with Secretary Clinton. I haven't heard major disagreements that she's had with Secretary Clinton so who's going to step up for the people of New Hampshire?" </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Since Trump launched his campaign last summer, he called some Mexicans "rapists" during his announcement speech, said Sen.
