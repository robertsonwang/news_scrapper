<div class="zn-body__paragraph">Speaking at a press conference in the southern German city Saturday, police officials said  the 18-year-old lone attacker -- who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound -- had no political motivations, and no references to religion had been found in documents in his home.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Rather, investigators searching his belongings found numerous documents on rampage killings, including a book entitled "Rampage in My Mind -- Why Students Kill," said Robert Heimberger, president of the Bavarian State Criminal Police Office. </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph"><h3>Neighbors ID gunman</h3></div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Neigbhors told CNN that the 18-year-old who lived in the apartment  searched by police was Ali Sonboly. CNN's Atika Shubert interviewed people who live in that building. In a press conference Saturday, German police said the gunman's parents had been taken in for questioning.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Police have not named the attacker, but said he had dual German and Iranian nationality and was born and raised in Munich.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph"><a href="/web/20160723190736/http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/23/europe/munich-shooting-what-we-know/index.html" target="_blank">Munich shooting: What we know</a></div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said Saturday it appeared that, before the attack, the gunman had hacked a woman's Facebook account to post a false "special offer" promising discounts at the McDonald's branch where the attack began, in order to lure people to the scene. Investigators were still working to confirm that, he said.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Police said there was also likely to be<strong> </strong>significance in the timing of the attack, five years to the day since <a href="/web/20160723190736/http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/24/world/europe/norway-breivik-trial/" target="_blank">Anders Behring Breivik</a> killed 77 people in Norway in 2011, many of them attendees at a youth camp. </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Munich Police Chief Hubertus Andrae said both attacks had predominantly targeted young people, with most of the victims in Munich in their teens.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph"><h3>Attack targeted the young</h3></div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Three of the victims were 14, two were 15, one was 17 and another 19, while a 20-year-old and a 45-year-old were also killed. Three were female. </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">The victims all were German nationals from the Munich area, officials said. Turkey's Foreign Ministry said three of the victims were also Turkish nationals, naming them as Sevda Dag, born in 1971; Can Leyla, born in 2001; and Selcuk Kilic, according to Turkey's semiofficial Anadolu news agency.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Another of the victims was also a Greek citizen, Greece's Foreign Ministry said Saturday.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">The attack left 27 people wounded, 10 of them with serious injuries, Andrae said.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph"><h3>Gunman's fatal wounds self-inflicted</h3></div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">The gunman stormed the McDonald's outside the Olympia mall in Munich on Friday evening, before continuing in to the shopping center, bringing Germany's third-largest city to a standstill as residents were warned to avoid public places and public transport was halted.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Authorities, initially fearing three gunmen were on the loose, mounted a massive operation involving 3,200 security personnel, and terrified shoppers sought safety in strangers' homes.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Police engaged in a shootout with the gunman,<strong> </strong>whose body was found near the scene of the attacks. An autopsy indicated he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police officials said. </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">No suicide note had been found in the attacker's home, and the attacker's parents were in too much of a state of shock to help police in their investigations, officials said.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">The attacker used a 9 mm Glock 17 pistol that was likely obtained illegally, because the serial number had been scratched off, and was found with about 300 rounds of ammunition in his rucksack, police said.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph"><h3>Attacker not known to authorities</h3></div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">De Maiziere said there had been no previous police or intelligence agency investigations into the attacker, the son of Shiite Muslims from Iran who came to Germany as asylum seekers in the 1990s.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">De Maiziere said there were indications the gunman had been bullied by his peers.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">"We know that in the apartment of the perpetrator, material was found which leads to him being interested in those who go on a  rampage," he said. "We do not have any indications that would lead to international terrorism."</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">The attacker had received medical treatment for mental health issues, a police official said, and in 2012 had been the victim of "bodily injury" in an incident involving other young people.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph"><h3>Security jitters in Europe</h3></div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">The attack shook Europe after a spate of recent terror attacks on the continent, including the stabbing of <a href="/web/20160723190736/http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/20/world/germany-train-attack/index.html" target="_blank">passengers on a German train</a> by a man who claimed to be inspired by ISIS, and the <a href="/web/20160723190736/http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/15/europe/terror-attacks-nice-why-france/">killing of 84 people</a> in a deadly truck attack in Nice, France.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">German Chancellor Angela Merkel referenced the ongoing public anxieties over the security climate as she expressed her condolences at a press conference in Berlin after a security meeting Saturday.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">"We are mourning those who will never go back to their families," she said, before addressing the bereaved families of the victims of Munich's "night of horrors." </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">"We share your pain. We think of you. We suffer with you."</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">She went on to express her gratitude for German security forces.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">"We live together in a liberal society. This freedom is our greatest strength," she said.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph"><h3>'He's ... killing the children'</h3></div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">A witness who was in the McDonald's restaurant said her son was in the bathroom with the gunman. </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">"That's where he loaded his weapon," said Lauretta, who only wanted to be identified by her first name.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">She said she saw many young casualties. </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">"I hear like an alarm and boom, boom, boom ... and he's still killing the children. The children were sitting to eat. They can't run."</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Lauretta said she heard the gunman say, "Allahu Akbar," or "God is great" in Arabic. </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">"I know this because I'm Muslim. I hear this and I only cry," she said.  </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph"><h3>'You will get it.'</h3></div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Witness Huseyin Bayri said he was riding his bike outside the restaurant when he saw the attacker yelling. </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">"I heard a scream at first: 'You shitty ... foreigners. I am German. You will get it,'" Bayri said.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">"And then the first shots were fired. And a boy of about 14 or 17 years of age ... collapsed, fell to the floor."</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Bayri jumped off his bike, crawled toward the wounded teenager and hid next to him. He tried to reassure him as he pressed on his gunshot wounds to stop the bleeding.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">"The boy asked for my help. I tried to talk with him, asked him his name, his age, if he has a girlfriend," Bayri said. "I tried to make sure that he looked at me, that his eyes are open."</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">The teen pleaded with Bayri to call an ambulance, but died just before it got there. </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph"><h3>From eatery to mall</h3></div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">After the shooting, the gunman moved across the street to the mall, which is near the site of the 1972 Summer Olympics where Israeli athletes were killed by Palestinian attackers.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Lynn Stein, who works in the mall, described a chaotic scene when gunfire erupted. </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">"People were very confused, and they were running and they were screaming," she said. </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">She saw someone lying on the floor of a store who appeared to be either dead or injured.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">"There's a woman over them, crying," she said. </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph"><h3>Verbal exchange</h3></div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Photos and video posted on social media showed a profanity-filled verbal exchange between a man on the top level of a parking garage and another one on a balcony. </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">The exchange, recorded on two camera phones, captured an intense conversation that ended in gunfire. The man who appeared to be a shooter said insulting things about Turks, did not espouse jihadist ideology and spoke with a German accent.</div>
