<div class="zn-body__paragraph">The damage was especially brutal in southern Haiti, where sustained winds of 125 mph continued to punish the impoverished island nation that saw trees topple to the ground and rain flood its streets Tuesday.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Mourad Wahba, the UN Secretary-General's Deputy Special Representative for Haiti, described Matthew as the "largest humanitarian event" since the earthquake.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph"><h3>'A total disaster'</h3></div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">At around 7 a.m. ET, Matthew made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane near Les Anglais, Haiti, <a href="/web/20161005101431/http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT4+shtml/041146.shtml" target="_blank">according to the National Hurricane Center</a>. Witnesses reported streets had flooded in the capital of Port-au-Prince, while heavy rains <a href="/web/20161005101431/https://twitter.com/jgabrielfortune/status/783288597357166593" target="_blank">pelted</a> the town of Les Cayes, according to Mayor Jean Gabriel Fortun√©.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">"We've already seen deaths. People who were out at sea. There are people who are missing. They are people who didn't respect the alerts," Interim Haitian President Jocelerme Privert said at a news conference.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">While the final death toll remains uncertain, Haitian church pastor Louis St. Germain said heavy rain had caused Haitian waterways to swell. Speaking to CNN on the phone from Les Cayes, Haiti, he said the storm sheared a wall off his house and tore roofs off many buildings in the area.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">"The river has overflowed all around us," St. Germain said. "It's terrible ... a total disaster."</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Forecasters had predicted Haiti might receive up to 40 inches of rain -- a disastrous amount for a nation still recovering from a devastating 2010 earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people. </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph"><a href="/web/20161005101431/http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/04/world/haiti-disasters/index.html">Haiti: a nation sadly familiar with hurricanes and earthquakes</a></div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">"Much of the population is displaced and communication systems are down," Wahba said. "We've received reports of destroyed houses and overflowing hospitals with shortages of buckets and fresh water. The hospital in Les Cayes has had its roof blown off by the force of winds."</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">More than 300,000 people are now in shelters across the country, the United Nations said.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Once the storm passes, residents could face risks from another threat -- standing water. Haiti is still recovering from a post-quake  <a href="/web/20161005101431/http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/18/health/haiti-un-cholera/">cholera outbreak</a> that killed 10,000 people.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">"Water is going to be a major issue," said Jean Claude Fignole, Oxfam's influence program director in Haiti. "Our priority is to get clean water and hygiene items to families as fast as possible to avoid a spike in cases of cholera. In the weeks and months to come, hunger is likely to emerge as big concern. Some crops in the South of the country have been totally destroyed."</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph"><h3>Death toll rising</h3></div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">At least seven people have died in incidents connected to Hurricane Matthew within the past week, authorities with multiple agencies said.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">In Haiti, Guillaume Albert Moleon, an Interior Ministry spokesman, said one fisherman died on Sunday.

CNN's Patrick Oppman, who is based in Cuba, said Tuesday night the storm still could cause damage including flooding rains and landslides.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Forecasters had predicted that Matthew could dump up to 20 inches of rain in eastern Cuba.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">The United States, taking no chances, airlifted 700 family members of military personnel stationed at Guantanamo Bay to Florida.

CNN meteorologists are expecting storm surges there as high as 15 feet, along with intense rains and damaging winds.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Bahamian Prime Minister Perry Christie cautioned at a news conference that Matthew had the potential to be "violently unpredictable."</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">"The storm has strengthened and, from what we have seen in Haiti and elsewhere, is bringing dangerously strong winds and extremely heavy rains," Christie said.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">The Bahamas could receive up to 15 inches of rain and experience swells with "life-threatening" surf and rip current conditions, the hurricane center <a href="/web/20161005101431/http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT4+shtml/050248.shtml" target="_blank">said</a>. </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">"[We've made] sure we got water, we got non-perishable foods," Bahamas resident Bruce Darville told CNN as he prepared for Matthew's arrival. "We've got a generator so we make sure that's all fueled up, make sure you're vehicle's fueled up. And we leave the rest to the good master."</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">As the storm neared the Bahamas, officials in the US <a href="/web/20161005101431/http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/05/us/hurricane-matthew-florida-carolinas/index.html">have taken steps to prepare for the storm's arrival</a> in the coming days.
