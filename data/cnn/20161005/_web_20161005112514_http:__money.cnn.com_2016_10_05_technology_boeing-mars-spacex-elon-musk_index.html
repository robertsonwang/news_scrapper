<p> "I'm convinced that the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding on a Boeing rocket," he told <a href="/web/20161010120227/http://www.theatlantic.com/live/events/whats-next-2016/2016/" target="_blank">an innovation conference</a> in Chicago. </p> <p> His comments come a week after Musk set out <a href="/web/20161010120227/http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/27/technology/spacex-elon-musk-mars-colonization/">his own plans</a> to colonize Mars. The SpaceX CEO has said he wants to send humans to the planet in 2024, with the spacecraft touching down in 2025. </p> <p dir="ltr" lang="en">Get to know <a href="/web/20161010120227/https://twitter.com/Boeing">@Boeing</a> Chairman, President and CEO Dennis Muilenburg and his vision for the future with these "10 Questions" <a href="/web/20161010120227/https://twitter.com/hashtag/WHATSNEXT100?src=hash">#WHATSNEXT100</a> <a href="/web/20161010120227/https://t.co/GLfl96CMSI">pic.twitter.com/GLfl96CMSI</a></p> <p> </p> <p> It wasn't immediately clear whether Muilenburg believes Boeing can get there sooner or just expects Musk to miss his targets. </p> <p> Boeing is developing a rocket for NASA known as the Space Launch System, which the space agency plans to use to go to Mars by the 2030s. </p> <p> Musk said last week that SpaceX had <a href="/web/20161010120227/http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/26/technology/elon-musk-spacex-raptor-engine-mars/index.html">successfully tested</a> a new rocket engine it plans to use to take people to the planet within the next 10 years. </p> <p> </p> <p> Besides Mars, Muilenburg also talked about other ambitious ideas at the Chicago conference, like hypersonic travel that would take people "anywhere in the world in a couple of hours." </p> <p> "Over the last 100 years ... men and women went from walking on the Earth to walking on the Moon," he said. "But when I look ahead to the next century, I think the opportunity for innovation and big change is even greater." </p> <p> Boeing and SpaceX <a href="/web/20161010120227/http://money.cnn.com/2016/05/12/news/companies/boeing-spacex-manned-flight/">are already competing</a> to be the first private company to carry U.S. astronauts into space. Both already have contracts with NASA to take astronauts to the International Space Station. </p> <p> SpaceX appeared to have <a href="/web/20161010120227/http://money.cnn.com/2016/05/12/news/companies/boeing-spacex-manned-flight/">gained an edge</a> in May when Boeing said it had pushed the date of its first manned space mission back to 2018 from 2017. </p> <p> </p> <p> But Musk's firm suffered a setback on Sept. 1 when one of its rockets was destroyed in an explosion on the launch pad. The company is <a href="/web/20161010120227/http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/09/technology/elon-musk-spacex-rocket-explosion/">still trying to figure out</a> what caused the fiery blast, but it's <a href="/web/20161010120227/http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/13/news/companies/spacex-launch-plans/">planning to return to space</a> as soon as November. </p> <p> <i>-- </i><i>Chris Isidore and Jackie Wattles contributed to this report.</i> </p> <p style="font-size: 8px; color: #c2c2c2; font-family: arial; line-height: normal; text-align: right; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 4px;">NMLS #1136</p> <p>Most stock quote data provided by BATS.
