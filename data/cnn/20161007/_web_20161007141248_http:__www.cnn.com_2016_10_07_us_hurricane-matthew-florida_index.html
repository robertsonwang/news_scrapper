<div class="zn-body__paragraph">Florida officials are very concerned about storm surges as Hurricane Matthew brushes the coast, and the "worst effects are still likely to come," Florida Gov. Rick Scott said Friday morning. </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Officials are particularly concerned about low-lying areas in Jacksonville, where there is potential for significant flooding, he said. </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">He said portions of the coast already have recorded 100 mph winds, and 10 feet of storm surge and a landfall still are possible for Jacksonville, he said. </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Scott said he hasn't heard of any fatalities related to Hurricane Matthew in his state so far. He said all major roads and interstate highways are open, and no major road or traffic issues have been reported. In some of the counties that the storm has passed, it appeared "the evacuations worked," he said. </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Still, he said, the state was not out of the woods.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">"While the storm is still on, don't go outside," he said.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">More than 22,000 people were in shelters, he said.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph"><strong><em>[Previous story, published at 9:07 a.m. ET]</em></strong></div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Hurricane Matthew's powerful eyewall was brushing Florida's east coast Friday morning, battering the Cape Canaveral and Daytona Beach areas with fierce winds and threatening the state with life-threatening storm surges.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">The biggest questions remained as the sun rose: Will the entire center cross into land? If so, where? </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">The outer eyewall of Matthew -- a Category 3 storm with winds of 120 mph at the center -- was brushing New Smyrna Beach north of Cape Canaveral as the storm teetered north-northwest toward Daytona Beach. </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Cape Canaveral recorded a 107 mph gust before 7 a.m. ET as the storm  pounding Florida's east-central coast with dangerous winds and heavy rai , the National Hurricane Center said. </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph"><a href="/web/20161007135617/http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/07/us/hurricane-matthew-hits-florida/index.html">What Florida looks like now</a></div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Weather experts were watching for the slightest change in Matthew's unpredictable path, which they say could make an enormous difference to the hurricane's impact on land.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">"The exact path is so critical," said CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam. "Miles and kilometers really count, because if it wobbles westward by say 30 miles, it brings those strong winds onshore."</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">More than 476,000 Florida Power &amp; Light customers were without power Friday morning. The downpour, storm surge and extreme winds are expected to hit central and northern sections of the Florida coast, including communities such as Daytona Beach and Jacksonville, according to the hurricane center.  </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph"><h3>Here's what you need to know:</h3></div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">• As of 9 a.m. ET,<strong> </strong>Matthew was about 45 miles southeast of Daytona Beach.<strong> </strong>Hurricane-force winds extended outward up to 60 miles from that center.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">• Based on <a href="/web/20161007135617/http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/refresh/graphics_at4+shtml/214535.shtml?5-daynl#contents" target="_blank">the latest projections</a>, Matthew could make landfall in Florida as a Category 3 storm,<strong> </strong>or it could skirt the coast and head north before possibly heading back toward land. </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">• Forecasters predict a storm surge in parts of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina that could be as high as 11 feet, and as many as 15 inches of rain could fall<strong> </strong>from central Florida to North Carolina.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph"><a href="/web/20161007135617/http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/05/us/hurricane-matthew-comparisons/index.html" target="_blank">How does Hurricane Matthew stack up against other storms?</a></div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">• The National Weather Service warned that some places hit by Matthew could be <a href="/web/20161007135617/https://twitter.com/CNNweather/status/784235866692739073" target="_blank">uninhabitable for "weeks or months."<strong></strong></a> </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">• The storm has <a href="/web/20161007135617/http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/05/americas/hurricane-matthew-cuba-haiti/index.html" target="_blank">killed at least 276 people </a>in three Caribbean countries.
