<div class="zn-body__paragraph">None of the 48 people on board were injured in the rough landing, which occurred on a rainy Thursday evening in the city.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">The press pool in the back of the aircraft, a Boeing 737-700 chartered from Eastern Airlines that was painted with the campaign's logo, could feel the plane fishtailing as it touched down and sliding off the runway before coming to a very sharp halt in the grass off the side of the runway.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Once the plane came to a full stop, the Indiana governor walked to the back of the plane to check on the press. As everyone on board deplaned, Pence could be seen speaking with emergency responders. </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">A spokesman for Pence said the vice presidential nominee would retire to his hotel for the evening, canceling an appearance at a closed-door fundraiser that had been scheduled in Trump Tower. He called into the event instead, a senior Pence aide said.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for Donald Trump's campaign, said the businessman called Pence shortly after the incident, adding that Trump "is very glad everyone onboard the plane is safe."</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">At the time of the incident, Trump was in Ohio, where he later addressed a rally in Geneva and briefly referenced the close call.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">"I just spoke to our future vice president, and he's OK. Do you know he was in a big accident with the plane?" Trump said. "Everybody's fine. But what a great decision it was to get Mike Pence. What a great guy he is. What a great job he's doing."</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Pence was due to campaign in Pennsylvania and North Carolina on Friday, and the campaign said his schedule would go forward as planned.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Following the incident, Pence tweeted, "So thankful everyone on our plane is safe. Grateful for our first responders &amp; the concern &amp; prayers of so many. Back on the trail tomorrow!"</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Hillary Clinton offered her regards via Twitter as well, writing, "Glad to hear @mike_pence, his staff, Secret Service, and the crew are all safe. -H"</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Rescue crews quickly responded on the scene, where there was some noticeable damage to the runway, although a campaign spokesperson told reporters there was no structural damage to the plane. A law enforcement source told CNN the damage to the runway was due to safety material at the end of the runway that is designed to break apart.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Dray Clark with <a href="/web/20161028114605/http://abc7ny.com/politics/pences-plane-removed-after-overshooting-laguardia-runway/1576417/" target="_blank">CNN affiliate WABC</a> tweeted video of the plane's front wheel being lifted out of the ground early Friday morning. </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">The Indiana governor's return trip to New York had initially been delayed due to inclement weather. His plane was kept in a ground hold at the airport in Fort Dodge, Iowa, earlier in the day. </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Pence took advantage of the flight delay to toss around a football with members of his staff and threw a few easy passes to the press.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Mary Schiavo, a former inspector general for the Department of Transportation, explained to CNN's Anderson Cooper that the weather likely prevented the plane from getting "good traction."</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">"When there's a layer of water on it, it is very much like hydroplaning in your car," she said, adding, "LaGuardia has had this very thing happen before."</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">A spokesperson for the Federal Aviation Administration told CNN it will be investigating the incident. A US official told CNN the National Transportation Safety Board was gathering preliminary information on the incident and will launch a team to investigate Friday morning.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey issued a statement confirming no one had been injured and that its personnel were on the scene. Planes were temporarily prevented from landing or taking off at the Queens airport, though the FAA later reported that departures and arrivals had partially resumed on one runway. Delays were expected to continue, the FAA said.</div>
