<div class="zn-body__paragraph">As an ambassador of Louisiana roots music, Dural traveled the world with his accordion, a ton of stage swagger and a deep love for his family and home state -- spreading the throbbing sounds of zydeco to millions of adoring fans. </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">"He died at 1:32 a.m. (Saturday) Louisiana time, keeping musician's hours right to the bitter end,"  longtime manager Ted Fox posted on the <a href="/web/20160925090801/http://buckwheatzydeco.com/" target="_blank">musician's website</a>.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">" I am grieving for my best friend and colleague of more than 30 years." </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph"><h3>Health problems</h3></div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Dural has suffered from health problems in recent years, including lung and throat cancer, Fox said. </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">His infectious brand of music, which honored south Louisiana Creole culture, earned him a 2010 Grammy and an Emmy, and numerous other awards. </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">"His music captured the food, music, language and dancing -- the way of life for people in the region," fellow musician Sean Ardoin told CNN. </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Ardoin said he saw Dural, whom he called Buck, in the last few weeks of his life. During a visit to his Lafayette, Louisiana, hospital room, Ardoin said,  he encouraged him to "take the music to another level."</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Besides performing his own traditional songs, Dural also played cover tunes. His version of the Jimi Hendrix classic "Hey Joe", was given a complete zydeco makeover that exposed his sounds to a new audience -- via rock radio stations.</div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">Dural regularly performed at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, and closed out the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. He also played several presidential inaugurations. </div> <div class="zn-body__paragraph">As far as his stage name goes, there's a story behind it. He earned the "Buckwheat" as a nod to the "Little Rascals" character, according to  <a href="/web/20160925090801/http://www.nola.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2016/09/buckwheat_zydeco_leader_stanle.html" target="_blank">NOLA.com</a>. </div>
