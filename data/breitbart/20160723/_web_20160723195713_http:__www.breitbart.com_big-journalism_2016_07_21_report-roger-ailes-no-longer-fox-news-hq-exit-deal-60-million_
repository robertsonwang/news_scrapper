[<p>\u201cRoger Ailes has made a remarkable contribution to our company and our country,\u201d said Murdoch in a statement. \u201cRoger shared my vision of a great and independent television organization and executed it brilliantly over 20 great years. Fox News has given voice to those who were ignored by the traditional networks and has been one of the great commercial success stories of modern media. It is always difficult to create a channel or a publication from the ground up and against seemingly entrenched monopolies\u2026 I am personally committed to ensuring that Fox News remains a distinctive, powerful voice. Our nation needs a robust Fox News to resonate from every corner of the country. To ensure continuity of all that is best about Fox News and what it stands for, I will take over as Chairman and acting CEO, with the support of our existing management team under Bill Shine, Jay Wallace and Mark Kranz.\u201d</p>, <p>Ailes, who founded the channel in 1996 with the financial backing of Rupert Murdoch, found himself at odds with Murdoch\u2019s two children, Lachlan and James, who are now leading the company.</p>, <p>\u201cWe join our father in recognizing Roger\u2019s remarkable contributions to our company\u201d the brothers said in a statement. \u201cOur talented Fox News and Fox Business colleagues, up and down the organization and on both sides of the camera, have built something that continues to redefine the cable news experience for millions of viewers. We are enormously proud of their accomplishments. For them, as well as for our colleagues across our entire organization, we continue our commitment to maintaining a work environment based on trust and respect. We take seriously our responsibility to uphold these traditional, long-standing values of our company.\u201d</p>, <p>Rupert Murdoch held a conference call with staff from the channel, according to anchor Bret Baier, who spoke to reporters in Cleveland.</p>, <p>\u201cBasically [the gist of the call] was we have a job to do, and he praised us for the coverage this week and said \u2018Let\u2019s do what we do best.\u2019 Yeah it was continuity, that was the message that came out of the conference call,\u201d Baier said.</p>, <p>In a letter to Rupert Murdoch, first\xa0<a href="/web/20160722125720/http://www.drudgereport.com/flashnowa.htm">published by The Drudge Report</a>, Ailes said how \u201cproud\u201d he was about the success of Fox News, adding: Having spent 20 years building this historic business, I will not allow my presence to become a distraction from the work that must be done every day to ensure that Fox News and Fox Business continue to lead our industry.\u201d</p>, <p>As the news broke, Fox News security was attempting to establish a perimeter around Fox News\u2019 space at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, where reporters had gathered to interview Fox News staff to get reactions to the news. At least one Fox staffer was visibly distraught by the news.</p>, <p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t talk to anybody from Fox News,\u201d a security guard told gathered reporters.</p>, <p>But former Fox News anchor and current Fox News contributor Brit Hume, anchor Greta Van Susteren, anchor Chris Wallace and Baier addressed the reporters who had gathered there.</p>, <p>\u201cThere are people in tears. I shed mine a couple of days ago when the stories started to come out,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cRoger Ailes is the best boss I\u2019ve had in almost a half a century in journalism. I admired him tremendously, professionally, and loved him, personally. He and Rupert built, came up with the idea of Fox in the beginning. And as sad as I am for Roger to go, I can\u2019t think of a better person to keep the vision of Fox News going than Rupert.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cI\u2019m absolutely heartbroken that all this happened. I love the guy, and I\u2019m heartbroken,\u201d Hume said.</p>, <p>Baier, when asked whether he was among the Fox News talent that had a \u201ckey man clause,\u201d which would allow him to leave Fox News Channel if Ailes does, responded \u201cYeah, I am.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cI can\u2019t speak for anyone else. I know a number of people have things in their contracts that are whatever they\u2019re called \u2013 key-man clauses or something. I can\u2019t speak for anyone else.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cI\u2019m really happy at Fox and as long as, you know, things are going like they\u2019re going I think I couldn\u2019t be happier,\u201d Baier added. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to change much from my perspective as what I do every day. I think a lot of what we do on the news side is bottom up and it\u2019s always been that way. I\u2019m betting that Rupert is going to continue with that same process.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cI will tell you, it was quite inspiring to all of us that Rupert Murdoch flew back and he\u2019s taking over the helm and he made everyone feel really good. He\u2019s not changing anything,\u201d Van Susteren said. \u201cChange is always tough, but I think Rupert Murdoch coming back was a big deal for all of us.\u201d</p>, <p>Read the rest <a href="/web/20160722125720/http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/07/draft-its-official-roger-ailes-to-step-down-at-fox-news-225886">here</a>.</p>, <p class="mol-para-with-font">According to <a href="/web/20160722125720/http://www.drudgereport.com/">the Drudge Report</a>, embattled Fox News CEO Roger Ailes will step down from the network, but stay on as a consultant for its\xa0parent company 21st Century Fox until 2018.
