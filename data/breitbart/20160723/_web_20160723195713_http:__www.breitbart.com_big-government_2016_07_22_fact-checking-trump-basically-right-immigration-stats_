[<p>Mason\u2019s verification came on the heels of <a href="/web/20160723160848/http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/07/21/frustrated-fact-checker-trumps-crime-stats-mostly-accurate/">confirmation</a> by another\xa0<em>Times</em> reporter, Seema Mehta, that Trump\u2019s crime numbers were \u201cmostly accurate,\u201d though Mehta went on to argue that \u201chis conclusions are a stretch.\u201d</p>, <p>The enterprise of \u201cfact-checking,\u201d a relatively recent phenomenon, attempts to inform readers and viewers about whether claims made by political candidates about the state of the world are actually true. In theory, fact-checking is meant to keep politicians honest, and guide public debate toward reasoned conclusions about policy, and prevent hyperbolic, divisive debates fueled by misinformation.</p>, <p>In practice, \u201cfact-checking\u201d makes debates more contentious by defending\xa0liberals and undermine conservatives on a partisan, not factual, basis \u2014 largely because the \u201cfact-checking\u201d is done by liberal publications.</p>, <p>In this case, Mason notes:</p>, <p>Here\u2019s what Trump contended in his nomination speech: \u201cThe number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015.\u201d</p>, <p>Trump is essentially correct here. According to <a href="/web/20160723160848/https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/southwest-border-unaccompanied-children/fy-2016%5D">statistics from the U.S. Border Patrol</a>, around 51,000 families \u2014 consisting of at least one child accompanied by at least one adult \u2014 have crossed the border since the beginning of the 2016 fiscal year, which started last October.</p>, <p>However, since no correct fact cited by a Republican can apparently be allowed to stand unchallenged, Mason adds: \u201cOverall, however, the number of people living in the country illegally has essentially leveled out since 2007.\u201d The implication is that Trump is making an issue out of a non-issue.</p>, <p><em>Joel B.
