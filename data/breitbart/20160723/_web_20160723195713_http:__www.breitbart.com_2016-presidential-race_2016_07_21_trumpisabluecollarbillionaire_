[<p><a href="/web/20160723171357/http://www.politico.com/story/2016/01/jerry-falwell-jr-endorses-trump-218238">Jerry Falwell</a>, who leads the Lynchburg, Virginia school his father founded, said <a href="/web/20160723171357/https://www.donaldjtrump.com/">Trump</a> is down-to-earth, loves America and the American people.\xa0\u201cHe is a true patriot and a champion of the common man,\u201d Falwell said.</p>, <p>One example of Trump\u2019s reverence for traditional American liberties is his support inserting for a plank in the GOP Platform which calls for the repeal of the so-called Johnson Amendment, Falwell said. The amendment is a 1954 change in the federal tax code, sponsored by Sen. Lyndon B. Johnson (D-Texas), which restricts political activity of\xa0non-profit organizations, principally churches.</p>, <p>\u201cConservative universities and churches have been investigated, while authorities has too often have turned a blind eye toward liberal groups, including universities, where left-wing ideology is so pervasive that they have in effect become Democratic voter indoctrination camps,\u201d said the attorney. \u201cTrust me. The repeal of the <a href="/web/20160723171357/http://www.christiantoday.com/article/johnson.amendment.trumps.greatest.contribution.to.christianity/90858.htm">Johnson Amendment</a> would create a huge revolution for conservative Christians and for free speech.\u201d</p>, <p>Falwell said the country is at a crossroads, where the first priority must be saving the nation.\xa0\u201cWe must unite behind Donald Trump and Mike Pence,\u201d he said.</p>, <p>Falwell obliquely addressed the controversy from the previous night, when Sen. Ted Cruz (R.-Texas) refused to endorse Trump and then this morning told the Texas delegates that he refused to be a \u201cservile puppy\u201d to Trump. Of course, a year ago March, <a href="/web/20160723171357/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/transcript-ted-cruzs-speech-at-liberty-university/2015/03/23/41c4011a-d168-11e4-a62f-ee745911a4ff_story.html">Cruz launched his own run for president at Liberty</a>. Then, Cruz positioned himself as the champion of religious liberty and the voice of the white evangelicals, who eventually swung to Trump.</p>, <p>\u201cIf you are a conservative, a decision not to vote or to vote for a third-party candidate is a de facto vote for Hillary Clinton,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Hillary Clinton is allowed to appoint the next few Supreme Court justices, that in itself could be a fatal blow to our Republic.\u201d</p>, <p>A vote for Trump \u201cis a vote to uphold the Second Amendment right to bear arms, a vote to stop Iran from funding terrorists and harming Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cA vote for Trump is a vote to appoint conservative, pro-life justices to the Supreme Court.\u201d</p>, <p>Falwell said in his<a href="/web/20160723171357/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/16/obituaries/16falwell.html?_r=0"> father\u2019s last days</a>, he joked with CNN that he dreamed that he had been interviewed by Chelsea Clinton about the three greatest threats to America;</p>, <p>He replied, \u2018The three greatest threats are: Osama, Obama and your mama.\u2019 Well, Osama is now gone, Obama has six months left in his term and the only way to \u2018Make America Great\u2013and One\xa0Again\u2019 is to tell Chelsea\u2019s mama: \u2018You\u2019re fired.\u2019</p>]
