[<p>\u201cThis idea that America is somehow on the verge of collapse, this vision of violence and chaos everywhere, doesn\u2019t really jive with the experience of most people,\u201d he said.</p>, <p>The president assured reporters that most people probably still woke up in an America that wasn\u2019t as frighting as Trump had indicated.</p>, <p>\u201cI hope people the next morning walked outside and birds were chirping and the sun was out, and this afternoon people will be watching their kids play in sports teams, and go to the swimming pool, and folks are going to work and getting ready for the weekend,\u201d Obama said.</p>, <p>He argued that Trump\u2019s fact-checked statistics on crime and immigration were misleading, citing a different set of statistics to support the notion that violent crime and illegal immigration were actually down in the last 20-30 years.</p>, <p>Both crime and illegal immigration, he argued, were lower than under President Ronald Reagan.</p>, <p>He acknowledged that Americans were concerned about the country, particularly after police officers had come under attack.</p>, <p>\u201cWe\u2019re all troubled by how we can rebuild trust, support law enforcement and make sure the communities feel that they are being fairly policed,\u201d he said.</p>, <p>Obama told reporters that he did not watch Trump\u2019s speech, but read some of the coverage of the RNC convention in the news.</p>, <p>\u201cI did not watch the convention. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a surprise,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of stuff to do and \u2014 and they are pretty long events.\u201d</p>]
