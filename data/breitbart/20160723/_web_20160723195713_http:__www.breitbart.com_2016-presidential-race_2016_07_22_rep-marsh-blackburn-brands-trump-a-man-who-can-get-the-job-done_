[<p>\u201cDo you want to help make America one again?\u201d Blackburn challenged a jubilant Republican crowd. Make America One Again was the theme of the fourth night of the RNC.</p>, <p>We have all had enough of bloated budgets, un-kept promises and pointless red lines.</p>, <p>We\u2019ve had enough division and enough heated rhetoric that serves to only drive a wedge between us and our neighbor. Enough seeing our 401ks get smaller, our bills get bigger, our taxes go up and our paychecks shrink. In short the American people have had it!</p>, <p>Yes and they are ready for a change \u2013 they are ready for someone to take the reins and bring us together.</p>, <p>There is someone that can get the job done. Or as Larry the Cable guy would say, Let\u2019s \u2018Git \u2018er done! There\u2019s someone who can come in ahead of schedule and under budget.</p>, <p>Who\u2019s read the specs, has seen the bottom line, negotiated the cost and built something to last. A leader who knows that this country is not full of assets to be managed, forgotten or deleted. Our nation is full citizens want a leader who knows the sure route to prosperity, who inspires, who knows that leadership is a hard-fought verb and not a subject line in an email.</p>, <p>In the course of the evening, Trump\u2019s history of developing prosperous properties was highlighted. His renovation\xa0of what is now Trump Tower in New York City was highlighted multiple times.</p>, <p>\u201cThat is why I am asking all of you to join me tonight in electing Donald Trump as President of the United States,\u201d declared Blackburn.</p>, <p>Donald Trump has the skills required to lead this nation, a diverse nation, who can help people achieve greatness. He believes in the American dream because he has lived the American dream.</p>, <p>Blackburn referenced former President Abraham Lincoln for a call made in Cleveland 155 years ago to \u201cbind together or perish apart.\u201d She <a href="/web/20160723154846/http://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4/1:332?rgn=div1;view=fulltext">quoted</a> Lincoln, \u201cIf all do not join now to save the good ship of the Union this voyage, nobody will have a chance to pilot her on another.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cAnd again we find our nation in desperate need of true leadership. In desperate need of unity,\u201d she warned.</p>, <p>The last eight years have really been a challenge, to our national and out household budgets, to our Constitution, and to the men and women who give their lives and their sacred honor to protect our Constitution and to protect us.</p>, <p>The Tennessee Representative again spoke of Trump\u2019s experience as a qualification and reason to elect Trump to the highest office in the land.\xa0\u201cDonald Trump is a leader who has seen challenges, he has learned his lessons, solved problems, he has delivered results.\u201d</p>, <p>As a\xa0small businesswoman she said, \u201cSome of our nation\u2019s greatest leaders have been people who have worked in the real world, who know firsthand how cumbersome rules and unnecessary regulations get in the way of greatness.\u201d</p>, <p>I want a President who knows that leadership is not as it appears, but is as it performs. Who has seen something through from beginning to completion. Who looks at the mundane and sees magnificence. After all, that\u2019s the magic of this country \u2013 that everyday people, with big ideas and\xa0 big dreams and the drive to complete them, not only can they change a skyline, they can change the world.</p>, <p>\u201cLeadership is not about lines on a resume,\u201d said Blackburn.</p>, <p>We want a President who believes that you, not Washington, knows best. Who believes that you have the right to pursue your version of the American dream.</p>, <p>America is on the edge of great, mighty things. We need a President Donald Trump who understands this, is about freedom and freedom\u2019s causes. Who will choose to unite us, not divide us.</p>, <p>\u201cAre you with Trump-Pence 2016?,\u201d she asked to a surge of enthusiasm.</p>, <p>Together we can get the country building, working, see jobs come back, our communities grow, and see leaders actually lead.</p>, <p>Together with you and with Trump-Pence 2016, we will be great again.</p>, <p>We will be one again.</p>, <p><i>Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter </i><a href="/web/20160723154846/https://twitter.com/MichelleDiana">@MichelleDiana</a><i>\xa0</i></p>]
