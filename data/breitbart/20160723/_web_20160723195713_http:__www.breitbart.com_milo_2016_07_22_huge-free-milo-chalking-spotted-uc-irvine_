Twitter will permanently ban popular conservatives for jokes but will leave up ISIS accounts actively recruiting terrorists, and does not equally apply its rules and their punishments. Twitter claims to be the bastion of Free Speech in the social media world but Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey prioritizes political feuds and vendettas over public safety. Leslie Jones, the very person Jack Dorsey claimed to protect by banning Yiannopoulos has now received more backlash and negative comments as a result of the ban. At the end of the day, only one person wins from banning Milo Yiannopoulos from Twitter: Jack Dorsey.</p>, <p>President Rowlands also released a longer statement in a post on Medium this Wednesday, quoted below. <a href="/web/20160723164521/https://medium.com/@IamQueenAri/statement-by-ariana-rowlands-president-of-college-republicans-at-uc-irvine-on-the-suspension-of-11dbf9033947#.yu21cxh28">You can read the full version here.</a></p>, <p class="graf--p graf-after--h3" id="6c1f">Yesterday, Twitter chose to permanently suspend the account of Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos, following complaints of harassment by actor Leslie Jones. Twitter, as a private company, did have the right to suspend Yiannopoulos based on his speech: he did, of course, agree to the service\u2019s terms and conditions while signing up. However, I believe that the suspension was not because of any service violation, but rather an opening shot in a war against speech they disagree with.</p>, <p class="graf--p graf-after--p" id="e78c">It is incumbent upon us, as users of Twitter and advocates of free speech, to be mindful that while all speech should be allowed, not all speech is necessarily appropriate. I do not believe that blatant attacks on a person based on their race, gender, or religion, for instance, are necessary or constructive towards meaningful debate. We should be careful that what we say advances our position and ideology, not just attacks for the sake of attacking. We are in a war of culture which we can win only by convincing others to join our cause. We only make ourselves out to be the villain when we attack and degrade.</p>, <p>Yiannopoulos\u2019 ban from Twitter prompted the hashtag <a href="/web/20160723164521/https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&amp;q=%23freemilo">#FreeMilo</a> to trend at number one worldwide, and he has since been regarded by media as a martyr for free speech.</p>, <p><i>Charlie Nash is a reporter\xa0for\xa0Breitbart Tech.
