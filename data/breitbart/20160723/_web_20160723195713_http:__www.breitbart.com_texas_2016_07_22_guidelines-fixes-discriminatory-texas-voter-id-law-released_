[<p>Corpus Christi-based federal district court Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos, an Obama appointee, released a scheduling order providing the parameters for how the discriminatory effects of the law can be \u201cameliorated\u201d in time for voting in the 2016 Election without scrapping the Texas Legislature\u2019s intent to protect against voter fraud, according to court documents obtained by Breitbart Texas.</p>, <p>In sum, voters possessing an <a href="/web/20160723171745/http://www.votetexas.gov/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/poster-aw.pdf">acceptable form of identification under SB 14</a> must provide it at the polling place. A solution for those without proper ID is due from the parties by August 17.</p>, <p>Judge Ramos outlined a six-point guide for what an interim fix should look like:</p>, <p>The scheduling order requires that all parties to the lawsuit, <em>Veasey v. Abbott</em>, meet by July 29 to \u201cdetermine what the plan terms may be subject to agreement. All sides must set forward their proposals by August 5 with a court hearing scheduled on August 17 to discuss \u201cany remaining differences.\u201d</p>, <p>Breitbart Texas <a href="/web/20160723171745/http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2016/07/20/texas-voter-id-law-ruled-discriminatory/">recently reported</a> on the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals decision that triggered the new round of discussions between the parties:</p>, <p>The appellate court maintained that the law was not passed with discriminatory intent, nor is it designed as a poll tax, effectively removing all constitutional claims against it. The Court further ruled that the lower district court must put in place an \u201cinterim remedy\u201d to mitigate the \u201cdiscriminatory effects\u201d some may feel from the law:</p>, <p>\u201cThe district court\u2019s immediate responsibility is to ensure the implementation of an interim remedy for SB 14\u2019s discriminatory effect that disrupts voter identification rules for the 2016 election season as little as possible, yet eliminates the [Voting Rights Act] Section 2 discriminatory effect violation.\u201d</p>, <p>The Court cautioned that the district judge \u201censure that any remedy enacted ameliorates SB 14\u2019s discriminatory effect, while respecting the Legislature\u2019s stated objective to safeguard the integrity of elections by requiring more secure forms of voter identification.\u201d</p>, <p>The case now continues in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Corpus Christi Division.
