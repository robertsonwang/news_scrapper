[<p>During the <a href="/web/20160723095455/http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/06/26/senator-tim-kaine-need-limit-ammunition-clips/">June 26 airing of <em>Meet the Press</em></a>, Kaine told Chuck Todd that he voted for\xa0an \u201cassault weapons\u201d ban before and \u201cwould likely vote for it again.\u201d But he stressed that he believes \u201climitations on the size of magazines and ammunition clips\u201d is the first step to take.</p>, <p>Todd asked Kaine if he believes the sale of AR-15 rifles ought to be illegal, and Kaine offered no direct answer, Instead, he suggested the problem with banning certain rifles is that the ban can be circumvented. Kaine said:</p>, <p>Here\u2019s the thing, I have voted for [the assault weapons ban], and I would likely vote for it again, but here\u2019s the practical problem I think you\u2019re aware of. As soon as you define what an assault weapon is\u2013that you can\u2019t sell a weapon and here\u2019s how to describe it\u2013gun manufacturers just make one adjustment or two and they say, \u201cSee, this isn\u2019t subject to the limitation.\u201d</p>, <p>On September 8, 2015\u2013just two weeks after Vester Lee Flanagan used a legally purchased firearm to kill news reporter Alison Parker on-air\u2013Kaine put forward a bill to hold licensed gun dealers liable for the misuse of firearms. The bill was designed to \u201craise the bar\u201d and require more \u201caccountability\u201d on the part of gun sellers.\xa0<em><a href="/web/20160723095455/http://www.roanoke.com/news/kaine-to-introduce-gun-bill-to-ensure-buyer-meets-federal/article_0cc2a66d-dbe6-5a56-847a-6465970acfa7.html" target="_blank">The Roanoke Times</a>\xa0</em>reported that\xa0Kaine\u2019s bill \u201cwould make gun sellers criminally liable for a bad sale if they didn\u2019t take reasonable, affirmative steps to determine the customer met federal criteria.\u201d</p>, <p>Consider the scenario\u2013Flanagan passed a federal background check for his gun. He passed the very same check that Hillary Clinton, Gabby Giffords, and others assure us will reduce crime and/or make us safer. But after passing the check and acquiring the gun, Flanagan carried out an evil deed. Background checks will never stop a latent criminal from getting a gun; they only stop actual criminals.</p>, <p>Yet even though the law was followed regarding Flanagan\u2013<em>a federal background check completed and passed</em>\u2013Kaine\u2019s response was to push for more liability on the licensed gun dealer. In other words, he\xa0wants the gun dealer held responsible for what a buyer does after exiting the store with a firearm the FBI allowed him to purchase.</p>, <p>This is Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate.</p>, <p><em>AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
