We\u2019re at a tipping point. The world is in a mess. This necklace of globalism that we have talked about has crumbled and shattered into a thousand shards. It needs a jeweler to take each of those jewels one by one, starting with America and its own diamond, and polish it. Then slowly, find the seamless strength to put them all back together, so what we look at is the necklace of prosperity and tolerance around the world.</p>, <p>Barrack recalled his own roots as the son of a Lebanese grocer in Culver City, and his 40-year friendship with Trump.
