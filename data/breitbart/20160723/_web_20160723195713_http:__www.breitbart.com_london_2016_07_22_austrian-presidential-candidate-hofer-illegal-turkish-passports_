[<p>In the immediate aftermath of the failed coup in Turkey last weekend Austrian Turks took to the streets of Vienna to express their support for President Recep Tayyip\xa0Erdo\u011fan by the thousands. The protests have led to many in the Austrian political scene to question\xa0how appropriate it is for the minority in the country to be so adamantly loyal to a foreign head of state.</p>, <p>Presidential candidate for the anti-mass migration Freedom Party (FP\xd6) Norbert Hofer is now calling for a government review of Turks who may possess dual citizenship with Austria and Turkey,\xa0<em>Kurier</em> <a href="/web/20160722201231/http://kurier.at/politik/inland/tuerkei-norbert-hofer-fordert-vorlaeufigen-stopp-fuer-einbuergerungen/211.025.687">reports</a>. Austria is unusual among European nations in that it is illegal, in most cases, to hold a dual citizenship with another nation.</p>, <p>Mr. Hofer told Austrian press that he believes there are a large number\xa0of people who possess both Turkish and Austrian citizenship and passports. He has also called for the exposure of any Turks in Austria who are directly cooperating with the Erdo\u011fan government. On Thursday the Erdo\u011fan regime <a href="/web/20160722201231/http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-to-temporarily-suspend-european-convention-on-human-rights-after-coup-attempt.aspx?PageID=238&amp;NID=101910&amp;NewsCatID=338">suspended</a>\xa0the European Convention of Human Rights and has expelled or <a href="/web/20160722201231/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/07/19/turkish-president-suspends-arrests-50k-plus-wake-failed-coup-attempt/">suspended</a>\xa0civil servants and academics, <a href="/web/20160722201231/http://www.breitbart.com/jerusalem/2016/07/21/turkish-academics-living-fear-erdogan-imposes-travel-ban/">banning</a>\xa0the latter from leaving Turkey.</p>, <p>According to Mr. Hofer, Turkey\u2019s announced plans to reinstate the death penalty pushes the state further from European values. \u201c<span class="goog-text-highlight">The value system of Turkey does not fit the EU. </span>I don\u2019t want to condemn the value system of Turkey, but it just does not suit us,\u201d he said.</p>, <p>In a press statement the presidential candidate said that Austria can\u2019t accept the fact that Ankara refuses to tell the government how many Austrian citizens share citizenship with Turkey. He claimed that the dual\xa0citizenship\xa0could form parallel societies within Austria. Mr. Hofer went so far as to\xa0say that the dual citizens should renounce\xa0their Austrian citizenship.</p>, <p>Currently in Austria there are around 90,000\xa0Turks\xa0who are\xa0eligible\xa0to vote in Turkish elections and the vast majority are fervent supporters of President\xa0Erdo\u011fan\u2019s Justice and Development (AKP) party. Of the total 300,000 or so men and women of Turkish decent living in Austria, around 113,000 of them carry a Turkish passport.</p>, <p>Mr. Hofer also mentioned the Grey Wolves, present\xa0at the weekend protests, who\xa0are notorious for <a href="/web/20160722201231/http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/07/20/kurds-fear-aggressive-erdogan-supporters-germany/">clashing</a>\xa0with Kurdish protesters and are accused of being ultra Turkish nationalists. \u201cTheir home is therefore not Austria, but Turkey,\u201d he said of the protesters.</p>, <p>The EU-Turkey migrant deal was also brought up by the candidate who said: \u201cI am also for the termination of the refugee agreement with Turkey,\u201d citing the constant <a href="/web/20160722201231/http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/04/09/turkeys-erdogan-will-sabotage-eu-migrant-deal-without-visa-free-travel-in-two-months/">threats</a>\xa0from Mr. Erdo\u011fan and allies toward the European Union. Mr. Hofer did not mince words calling the actions of Ankara \u201cblackmail\u201d.</p>]
