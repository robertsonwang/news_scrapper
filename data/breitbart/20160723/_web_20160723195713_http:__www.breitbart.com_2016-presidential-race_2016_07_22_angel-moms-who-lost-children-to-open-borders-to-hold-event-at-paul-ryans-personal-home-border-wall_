Dan wrote: \u2018This way Speaker Ryan can see first hand what pandering to the cheap illegal labor lobby means to Americans who can\u2019t afford to put a security fence up around their house.\u2019 But Paul Ryan ignored Dan\u2019s plea.\u201d</p>, <p>On April 27, 2002, Agnes Gibboney\u2019s son, 29 year-old son Ronald Da Silva, was standing in his girlfriend\u2019s driveway talking to a friend when he was suddenly shot and killed by a previously deported illegal alien.

Last year, Ryan <a href="/web/20160724163458/http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/12/16/paul-ryan-betrays-america-1-1-trillion-2000-plus-page-omnibus-bill-funds-fundamental-transformation-america/">voted</a> to fund the President Obama\u2019s resettlement of illegal immigrant border crossers into the interior of the U.S.</p>, <p>In stark contrast to Speaker Ryan\u2013 who has been accused of ignoring these families and working against their interests\u2013the Republican Party\u2019s nominee, Donald Trump, has become their\xa0champion.</p>, <p>In his Thursday night acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, Trump named just a few of the American victims specifically and said: \u201cI\u2019ve met Sarah\u2019s [Sarah Root\u2019s] beautiful family. But to this Administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn\u2019t worth protecting. One more child to sacrifice on the altar of open borders.\u201d</p>, <p>Trump continued:</p>, <p>Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more deeply than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our border. These families have no special interests to represent them. There are no demonstrators to protest on their behalf. My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain. Instead, my opponent wants Sanctuary Cities. But where was sanctuary for Kate Steinle? Where was Sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann [Mendoza], Sabine [Durden] and Jamiel [Shaw]? Where was sanctuary for all the other Americans who have been so brutally murdered, and who have suffered so horribly? These wounded American families have been alone. But they are alone no longer. Tonight, this candidate and this whole nation stand in their corner to support them, to send them our love, and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering the same awful fate.</p>, <p>\xa0</p>]
