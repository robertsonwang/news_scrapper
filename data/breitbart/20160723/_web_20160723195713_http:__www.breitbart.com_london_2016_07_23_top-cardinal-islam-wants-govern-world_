[<p>Cardinal Raymond Burke said that while Muslims were \u201clovely people\u201d, their religion teaches that it should dominate the state, and any country with a Muslim majority must submit to Islamic law.</p>, <p><a href="/web/20160723221603/http://religionnews.com/2016/07/21/us-cardinal-says-christian-nations-in-west-must-counter-islamic-influx/">Speaking to</a> <em>Religion News Service</em>, the American cardinal criticised Christian leaders who \u201csimply think that Islam is a religion like the Catholic faith or the Jewish faith.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cThat simply is not objectively the case,\u201d he claimed.</p>, <p>\u201cWhen they become a majority in any country then they have the religious obligation to govern that country,\u201d the cardinal added. \u201cIf that\u2019s what the citizens of a nation want, well, then, they should just allow this to go on. But if that\u2019s not what they want, then they have to find a way to deal with it.\u201d</p>, <p>He also said that areas of France and Belgium have become \u201cno-go zones\u201d that are effectively \u201clittle Muslim states\u201d.</p>, <p>When asked how the West should respond to increasing Islamisation, Cardinal Burke said: \u201cI think the appropriate response is to be firm about the Christian origin of our own nation, and certainly in Europe, and the Christian foundations of the government, and to fortify those.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cWe have to say no, our country is not free to become a Muslim state,\u201d he added.</p>, <p>The cardinal was speaking ahead of the publication of his book <em>Hope For The World: To Unite All Things In Christ</em>, which takes the form of an extended interview.</p>, <p>The <em>Catholic Herald</em> <a href="/web/20160723221603/http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2016/07/22/cardinal-burke-its-reasonable-to-be-afraid-of-islams-desire-to-govern-the-world/">quotes</a> the cardinal as saying in the book: \u201cIslam is a religion that, according to its own interpretation, must also become the State. The Koran, and the authentic interpretations of it given by various experts in Koranic law, is destined to govern the world.</p>, <p>\u201cIn reality, there is no place for other religions, even though they may be tolerated, as long as Islam has not succeeded in establishing its sovereignty over the nations and over the world.\u201d</p>, <p>Cardinal Raymond Burke is patron of the Sovereign Order of Malta and is seen as one of the leading figures among traditionalist Catholics. He has become known for his uncompromising conservative views and has a strong affinity for the traditional Latin Mass.</p>, <p>\xa0</p>]
