Both assaults have been linked to jihadism.</p>, <p>Armed with a handgun, the attacker opened fire at a McDonald\u2019s restaurant and continued along the street before entering the mall.</p>, <p>A police patrol shot and wounded the gunman but he managed to escape before police found the body of what they believed was the \u201conly shooter.\u201d</p>, <p>Among the nine killed were three Kosovans, according to the foreign ministry in Pristina, while Munich police said the injured included children.</p>, <p>\u2013 Scenes of panic \u2013</p>, <p>A video posted on social media appeared to show a man in black walking away from a McDonald\u2019s while firing repeatedly on people as they fled screaming.</p>, <p>Survivors described terrifying scenes as shoppers rushed from the area, some carrying children in their arms.</p>, <p>\u201cWe entered McDonald\u2019s to eat\u2026 then there was panic, and people ran out,\u201d one woman told Bavarian television.</p>, <p>Another video appeared to show the gunman on a car park roof exchanging a tirade of insults with a man on a nearby balcony.</p>, <p>\u201cI\u2019m German, I was born here,\u201d the assailant replies after the man fired off a volley of swear words, including an offensive term for foreigners.</p>, <p>Police initially believed there could be up to three assailants.</p>, <p>But Andrae later said two others had \u201cabsolutely nothing to do\u201d with the attack \u2014 and that they were simply fleeing the scene.</p>, <p>Munich\u2019s main train station was evacuated and metro and bus transport suspended for several hours while residents were ordered to stay inside, leaving the streets largely deserted.</p>, <p>\u2013 \u2018Europe stands united\u2019 \u2013</p>, <p>President Joachim Gauck said he was horrified by the \u201cmurderous attack\u201d, while US President Barack Obama voiced staunch support for Washington\u2019s close ally.</p>, <p>\u201cOur thoughts are with the victims, their families, and all German people. Europe stands united,\u201d EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said on Twitter.</p>, <p>Europe has been on high alert for terrorism after a string of attacks in neighbouring France and Belgium claimed by IS.</p>, <p>The attack came just days after a 17-year-old asylum seeker went on a rampage with an axe and a knife on a train on</p>, <p>Monday near Wuerzburg, also in Bavaria, injuring five people.</p>, <p>Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere had said that assailant was believed to be a \u201clone wolf\u201d who appeared to have been \u201cinspired\u201d by IS but was not a member of the jihadist network.</p>, <p>On July 14, 31-year-old Tunisian Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel used a truck to mow down 84 people, including children, after a Bastille Day fireworks display in Nice, the third major attack on French soil in the past 18 months.</p>, <p>Friday\u2019s massacre spurred many in Munich to think the unthinkable.</p>, <p>\u201cIt has reached us. People in Munich have long had a queasy feeling. Fears grew with every attack in Paris, Istanbul or Brussels,\u201d said the Abendzeitung newspaper\u2019s editor-in-chief Michael Schilling.</p>, <p>\u201cThere were particular concerns about the Oktoberfest. But since Friday it is clear that there can be no security anywhere, not even in the safest German city.\u201d</p>, <p>The train attack had already triggered calls by some politicians to impose an upper limit on the number of refugees coming into Germany, which accepted a record 1.1 million migrants and refugees last year, many through Bavaria.</p>]
