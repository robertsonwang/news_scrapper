[<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it strange that a non-comedic actor has one of the funniest roles in \u2018Ghostbusters\u2019? Aside from Kate McKinnon, playing a bonkers scientist with endless facial tics, Kevin, played by Chris Hemsworth, delivers most of the biggest laughs,\u201d <a href="/web/20160723173709/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2016/07/21/the-problem-with-chris-hemsworths-stunt-casting-in-ghostbusters/">wrote Merry in her latest piece on the film</a>.</p>, <p>\u201cHe plays the ghoul-shooting quartet\u2019s idiotic secretary. He\u2019s not much of an assistant \u2014 an 8-year-old would probably do a better job \u2014 but he\u2019s so nice to look at that he gets the\xa0gig,\u201d Merry notes.</p>, <p>Merry complains that because Hemsworth was the funnier character, <em>Ghostbusters</em> is not actually a film based on feminism and equality.</p>, <p>\u201cThe idea behind the casting was clearly surface-level feminist stuff. After years of seeing hot women subjected to the male gaze, \u2018Ghostbusters, set out to even the playing field. How does it feel to be ogled, Chris?\u201d Merry opines, casually describing modern feminism as not being a movement focused on equality but rather maintaining negative gender roles but with the sexes\xa0switched.</p>, <p>\u201cThe difference, of course, is that he\u2019s not just there for his looks; he also gets some choice lines. So much for equality,\u201d complains Merry.</p>, <p>Merry extrapolates Hemsworth upstaging his female counterparts into a problematic trend across Hollywood: \u201cShould the inequality be surprising? Of course not. After all, we know that more men than women get roles on the big screen, and\xa0the discrepancy between the number of lines\xa0male and female actors get to say on-screen is particularly egregious.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cBut wouldn\u2019t it be nice if, before someone gives the sad-eyed Kit Harington the chance to prove he can send us into a fit of giggles, someone lets Kate Winslet, Lupita Nyong\u2019o or Serena Williams\xa0have their chance? A moviegoer can dream,\u201d she bemoans.</p>, <p>Apparently\xa0<em>Ghostbusters</em> director Paul Feig and the rest of the team were blind to the number one mistake of trying to appease social justice warriors: in the end their job is to complain,\xa0act\xa0oppressed, and play the victim. They will never be satisfied with your offering.\xa0<em>Ghostbusters</em> was never going to be an exception.</p>, <p><em>Editor\u2019s note: This story has been updated to correct the spelling of the Washington Post author\u2019s name.</em></p>, <p><i>Charlie Nash is a reporter\xa0for\xa0Breitbart Tech.
