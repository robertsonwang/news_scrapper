[<p><strong>Trump\u2019s speech: \xa0Effective enough.</strong></p>, <p><strong>1)</strong>\xa0Reagan\u2019s famous circuit-tested \u201cThe Speech\u201d was all facts like Trump\u2019s opening. Can be very effective.</p>, <p><strong>2)\xa0</strong>Smart decision to implicitly praise Obama (for putatively regretting appointing Hillary!);</p>, <p><strong>3) </strong>\u201c<em>Americanism not Globalism\u201d</em>\xa0\u2014 This section kind of skimpy. Trump seems to have chosen the more conventional law-and-order template. Not so interesting, but he\u2019s not trying for tenure.</p>, <p><strong>4)</strong>\xa0\u201cThings will never change\u201d vs. \u201cthings have to change.\u201d Auspicious anti-reification theme! \u201cThe Democrats have explained the economy in various ways. \u2026\u201d</p>, <p><strong>5)\xa0</strong>Hillary\u2019s \u201cTerrible, terrible crimes\u201d \u2014 a bit overstated, no? Terrible judgment, yes.</p>, <p><strong>6)\xa0</strong>Not sure I like the \u201cI\u2019m the strong man who can defend you powerless people\u201d posture. In a democracy, people aren\u2019t powerless. Why not say that?</p>, <p><strong>7) \xa0</strong>\u201cAbandon policy of \u2026 regime change.\u201d Can\u2019t say it\u2019s substanceless.</p>, <p><strong>8) </strong>\u201cDecades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for African-American and Latino workers.\u201d OK, I\u2019m happy. But he quickly goes back to talking about violence. Would prefer mockery of open-borders economic Polyannaism, like that of \u2026 Paul Ryan.</p>, <p><strong>9) </strong>\u201cNot alone any longer.\u201d\xa0OK, that resonates.</p>, <p><strong>10)</strong>\xa0Any sellout on The Wall just got a bit harder;</p>, <p><strong>11)</strong>\xa0Visa overstay issue is important to Latino voters \u2014 i.e. it\u2019s not just the people (mainly Latinos) sneaking across the Mexican border who can bid down wages and take U.S. jobs.</p>, <p><strong>12) \xa0</strong>\u201cAmericans want relief from uncontrolled immigration. \u2026\xa0Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty, mass immigration, and mass lawlessness. Her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals,\u201d Brexit-tested<strong>!\xa0</strong></p>, <p><strong>13)\xa0</strong>OK, the Steve Miller section\u2019s over. Time to wrap it up. \u2026</p>, <p><strong>14)</strong>\xa0The promise to appoint \u201ca person of similar views\u201d to Scalia seems way more significant than Trump\u2019s previous list of judges (a list that could be added to later);\xa0<strong>\xa0</strong></p>, <p><strong>15:</strong>\xa0\u201cI will fight for you.\u201d Bob Shrum wins again.</p>]
