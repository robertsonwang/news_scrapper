[<p>Speaking shortly after the Nice attack, Marion Mar\xe9chal-Le Pen, niece to Marine Le Pen and one of the FN\u2019s two National Assembly members, told her supporters: \u201cEither we kill Islamism or it will kill us again and again. You are with us and against Islamism, or you are against us and for Islamism\u2026 Those who choose the status quo become complicit with our enemies.\u201d</p>, <p>Expanding on the comments in an <a href="/web/20160724161554/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/politics/exclusive-interview-with-frances-youngest-and-most-controversial/">interview</a> with <em>The Telegraph,</em> she says that radical Islam is implacably opposed to the French secular way of life. \u201cWe have a heritage of faith linked to secularity, and I would always defend that. It\u2019s quite opposite to the radical Islamic faith, which seeks to impose itself more and more on public life.\u201d</p>, <p>Challenged over her views on the grounds that they would appall many, she responds: \u201cI have exposed reality.\u201d</p>, <p>She continued: \u201cThe attacks that took place in France at the\xa0Bataclan\xa0[in Paris last November] were carried out by terrorists who infiltrated their way into the flood of immigrants arriving from Greece.</p>, <p>\u201cFree movement of goods and people is a way of feeding terrorism. France\u2019s migration policy has contributed to the explosion of radical Islam here and to the genesis\xa0of those terrorists who are born in France.\u201d</p>, <p>A devoted Catholic, she defends comments made some time ago in which she said that \u201cIslam should not have the same public space as Catholicism.</p>, <p>\u201cWe have traditions, cultural influences that are Christian. France\xa0is not an Islamic country, and Islam should not have the same place in public life.\u201d</p>, <p>But she draws a distinction between the secular world of French politics and personal religion, insisting: \u201cI make a big distinction between my political combat and my faith. I never mix the two.\u201d</p>, <p>Her comments echo those of the American Catholic Cardinal Raymond <a href="/web/20160724161554/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/03/24/cardinal-raymond-burke-italy-should-focus-more-on-problems-of-italian-citizens-not-just-migrants/">Burke</a>, who this week <a href="/web/20160724161554/http://religionnews.com/2016/07/21/us-cardinal-says-christian-nations-in-west-must-counter-islamic-influx/">warned</a> that Islam is \u201cfundamentally a form of government,\u201d and wants to \u201cgovern the world.\u201d</p>, <p>Stressing that he did not want to be \u201cdisrespectful\u201d of Islam or \u201cgenerate hostility,\u201d he criticised Catholic leaders for their tendency \u201cto simply think that Islam is a religion like the Catholic faith or the Jewish faith.\u201d</p>, <p>He said that is not the case. Unlike Jews or Christians, \u201cwhen they [Muslims] become the majority in any country they have the duty to submit the whole population to <a href="/web/20160724161554/http://www.breitbart.com/tag/sharia-law/">Sharia </a>[Islamic law].\u201d</p>, <p>He continued: \u201cI think the appropriate response is to be firm about the Christian origin of our own nation [America], and certainly in Europe, and the Christian foundations of the government, and to fortify those.\u201d</p>, <p>As for Mar\xe9chal-Le Pen, as well as reasserting France\u2019s traditional Christian values she believes that an answer can be found in part by France leaving the European Union. She agrees with Nigel Farage that staying in the EU paves the way for more attacks on French women by migrants.</p>, <p>\u201cThese people arrive with a different language and culture and without being educated in the same way about women\u2019s rights,\u201d she says.</p>, <p>\u201cBrexit opens an avenue for us. While France and the UK are not entirely comparable, it [will demonstrate] that it\u2019s possible to leave without the cataclysm of which opponents warned. The UK will reap the benefits, and France will be reassured that the route is open.\u201d</p>, <p>Asked whether \u2018<a href="/web/20160724161554/http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/06/24/brexit-victory-euro-nationalists-call-frexit-nexit/">Frexit</a>\u2019 could happen, she says: \u201cYes, if\xa0Marine Le Pen\xa0is elected.\u201d</p>, <p>The wide-ranging interview also took in Mar\xe9chal-Le Pen\u2019s views on gay marriage and gay adoption. Unsurprisingly, as a practicing Catholic, she is against both.</p>, <p>\u201cOnce you break away from the natural framework\xa0of a man and a woman, you could have other minorities who want their form of love recognised by the state. If you endorse homosexuality [in marriage], why not polygamy?\u201d she asks.</p>, <p>And explaining her stance on gay adoption, she says: \u201cI believe that it\u2019s very important for a child to have a father and a mother, and that parents aren\u2019t interchangeable. I am very attached to the idea that my husband spends time with our daughter and that he fulfils his role.\u201d</p>, <p>And defending herself from assertions that her views are bigoted and racist, she counters that she is merely upholding traditional French values with the <a href="/web/20160724161554/http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/05/18/top-vatican-cardinal-blasts-demonic-attacks-family-washington-breakfast/">family </a>at the heart of society.</p>, <p>\u201cInvective allows people to claim the moral high ground,\u201d she says. \u201cI defend the French culture. I want France to remain true to\xa0the adage, \u2018When in Rome, do as the Romans do.\u2019 I don\u2019t want a culture imported from elsewhere. That\u2019s not a racialist vision. It has nothing to do with skin colour.</p>, <p>\u201cI feel I have two patriotic duties. One is to defend the independence and sovereignty of my country, and the other is to produce children to transmit that message.\u201d</p>]
