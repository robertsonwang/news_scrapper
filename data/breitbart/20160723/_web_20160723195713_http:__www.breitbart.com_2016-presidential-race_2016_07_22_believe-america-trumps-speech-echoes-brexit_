[<p>Speaking in front of the crowd at the Republican National Convention (RNC) tonight Mr. Trump hit several regular populist talking points: immigration and the criminality that stems off the back of it, the disinterest of the global establishment in the lives of the everyman and woman, and political stitch ups masquerading as trade deals.</p>, <p>But perhaps more than anything his was a speech that revolved around the importance of national sovereignty and the protection of U.S. interests.</p>, <p>This was nothing short of a \u2018Brexit\u2019 spirit, underscored by his uses of the phrase \u201cBelieve in America\u201d, directly comparable to the \u201cBelieve in Britain\u201d slogan used by Britain\u2019s UK Independence Party (UKIP) at the 2015 General Election and resurrected from the recently victorious Brexit campaign.</p>, <p>Watching closely from a senior Republican politician\u2019s private box at the Quicken Loans Arena was none other than the outgoing UKIP leader Nigel Farage.</p>, <p>After hearing the speech, he told me: \u201cI have been flabbergasted at the impact Brexit has had on American politics. I saw things that Trump said last night that had a very familiar ring\u201d.</p>, <p>Mr. Trump\u2019s most Brexit-like moment was perhaps when he said: \u201c<span class="s1">No longer can we rely on those elites in media, and politics, who will say anything to keep a rigged system in place. Instead, we must choose to Believe In America. History is watching us now. It\u2019s waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong. My opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty pledge. It reads: \u2018I\u2019m With Her\u2019. I choose to recite a different pledge. My pledge reads: \u2018I\u2019M WITH YOU \u2013 THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\u2019 I am your voice\u201d.</span></p>, <p><span class="s1">He also said: \u201c</span><span class="s1">The most important difference between our plan and that of our opponents, is that our plan will put America First. Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo\u201d.</span></p>, <p><span class="s1">These \u201cfamiliar\u201d turns of phrase are likely to have been impacted by the Brexit result at the bare minimum, emboldening to Trump and his campaign the idea that the establishment can indeed be taken on and beaten in a head to head match up.</span></p>, <p><span class="s1">If Austrian nationalist Norbert Hofer wins in October \u2013 the same day the Hungarians vote in a referendum on EU migrant quotas \u2013 then Mr. Trump will go into November hoping to become the jewel in the crown of the nationalist, populist right across the globe.</span></p>]
