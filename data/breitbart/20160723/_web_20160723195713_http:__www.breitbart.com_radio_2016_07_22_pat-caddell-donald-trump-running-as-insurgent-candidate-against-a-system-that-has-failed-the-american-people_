[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThey\u2019re all gonna be like they were on Brexit,\u201d Caddell predicted to SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon on Friday\u2019s <em>Breitbart News Daily</em>. \u201cThey haven\u2019t got a clue.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caddell said that when Trump told the audience he would \u201ctell the truth about the country,\u201d he was saying \u201cwhat 75 percent or more of Americans believe.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cPeople talk about, well, you know, 67 percent of the people think the country is on the wrong track. Uh-uh, folks. 67, 68 percent believe America is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in decline,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201d he pointed out, adding:</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 80-some percent that believe the system is rigged, the system works for those with power and influence, the anti-political class feeling \u2013 what I saw last night was, what he did is, he connected to all of those feelings out there, and he made a powerful case, and he made it in a broad way.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cHe was the first presidential candidate I can think of, in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ever, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to use the word \u2018corruption\u2019 in his acceptance speech,\u201d Caddell noted. \u201cThat word, you will not hear in Philadelphia next week.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also said Trump\u2019s speech was \u201cmuch more inclusive than I think anyone expected,\u201d which made some of the negative commentary seem wildly off-base to him.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThe political class is bound and determined to try to destroy him,\u201d Caddell declared. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t really threaten their power. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">voters </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">threaten their power. This was a powerful evocation of that.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caddell went on to say:</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought the whole night was a huge success, including Peter Thiel, who I thought was really good, Ivanka Trump, who was brilliant in terms of, about her father, and Trump himself \u2013 you know, you can criticize it was long, but it connected to the American people \u2013 at least, the people who watched the speech, according to CNN, and that must have choked them, to have to report their own numbers.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bannon clarified that while the media were\xa0hammering out its denunciations of Trump\u2019s speech as \u201cdark\u201d and alienating, flash polls were rolling in that showed 56 percent of respondents were more likely to vote for him after hearing it, while only ten percent said they were less likely. Caddell added that 75 percent thought it was an \u201coptimistic\u201d speech, which must have been a particularly difficult number for the Dark Trump media chorus to swallow.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caddell derided the panels assembled by the media to perform instant commentary as including Republicans who were \u201cBush people who hate Donald Trump, and who, watching it in a bar, root for Hillary Clinton,\u201d along with extreme leftists like Van Jones, whom Bannon described as going through a \u201cmeltdown\u201d during Trump\u2019s speech.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over on MSNBC, Caddell found Mike Murphy serving as an analyst \u2013 \u201cthe man who destroyed the campaign of Jeb Bush, and ran off with millions of dollars, had the worst campaign, spent the most money, the most disastrous campaign in primary history, probably.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThe thing about the political class is, not one of them has understood this country, and what\u2019s happened this year,\u201d Caddell declared. \u201cI have been on your show many times talking about the paradigm change, the country rising up. They can\u2019t see that. They keep arguing the conventional wisdom that is being destroyed this year, and being turned on its head, and they </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">still </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">can\u2019t get it.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cHe wasn\u2019t running as the Republican candidate for president,\u201d he said of Trump\u2019s strategy. \u201cHe\u2019s running as the independent Republican, or independent American, candidate for president. \u2026 He\u2019s running as an insurgent candidate against a system that has failed the American people.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caddell\xa0said his favorite line of the speech was when Trump said, \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you the facts that they edit out of their nightly broadcasts, and out of the coverage in their papers in the morning.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThat, to me, is what he did,\u201d pronounced Caddell. \xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said Democrats were responding as expected, painting Trump as \u201cunqualified\u201d and talking about \u201cdark hints of Hitlerism.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThey are going to make their case that he is dangerous,\u201d Caddell predicted. \u201cThey have just spent forty-two-some million dollars in the key swing states, in the last 60 days, and have moved </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nothing</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, have declined.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He anticipated a Democrat failure similar to what befell the heavily funded Jeb Bush campaign, as massive advertising expenditures prove far less effective than the political class expects because, he said, \u201cThis is not about money. It is about message. It is about </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">big </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">message.\u201d \xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cWe were far more successful in 1980 at trying to box in Ronald Reagan, until we debated him \u2013 and when I say, \u2018We,\u2019 I mean the Carter camp,\u201d Caddell recalled, speaking as a veteran of that campaign. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2016, he found Democrats fumbling to excuse Hillary Clinton\u2019s enormous negatives, such as her email scandal, which he noted the majority of Americans still regard as an indictable \u201ccrime,\u201d not a \u201cmistake.\u201d Caddell saw this as a symptom of dissonance that will make it very difficult for Democrats to impose their narrative on the election.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pat Caddell is a regular on Fox News\u2019 <em>Political Insiders</em>, regularly seen on Sundays at 7:30 p.m. Eastern. He can be seen in the one-hour <em>Political Insiders</em> special this Saturday at 8:00 p.m., which will\xa0repeat several times thereafter. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said this special broadcast will\xa0examine \u201cthe leftward turn of the Democratic Party, and the movement away, I argue, from what has been the traditional view of the Democrats.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cIt\u2019s a preview of the convention to come,\u201d Caddell said. \u201cI urge everybody who\u2019s interested to watch it. I think you\u2019ll see things, comments and discussion, that you will not see anywhere else, including with the media in Philadelphia.\u201d </span></p>, <p><em>Breitbart News Daily</em> airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m.\xa0to 9:00 a.m.\xa0Eastern.</p>, <p><strong>LISTEN:</strong></p>, <p><iframe frameborder="no" height="400" scrolling="no" src="/web/20160723172215if_/https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F274852422&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;maxwidth=990&amp;maxheight=1000" width="990"></iframe></p>]
