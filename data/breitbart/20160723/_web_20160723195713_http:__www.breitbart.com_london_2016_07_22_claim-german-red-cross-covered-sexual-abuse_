[<p>The Red Cross in the German city of Potsdam are under fire as an allegation has emerged that sexual abuse of women in one of their asylum homes is not just happening, but is being actively covered up by management.</p>, <p>An anonymous letter was sent to the head office of the German branch of the Red Cross by someone claiming to have been an employee at the Potsdam asylum home. The whistleblower accused the management of covering up the constant sexual abuse of female migrants in the home, German TV channel <em>Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg\xa0</em><a href="/web/20160723163929/http://www.rbb-online.de/politik/thema/fluechtlinge/brandenburg/2016/07/schwere-vorwuerfe-gegen-drk-erstaufnahme-in-potsdam.html">reports</a>.</p>, <p>The letter specifies that female colleagues of the worker were also sexually harassed and mocked by male migrants in the home. According to the employee the management were well aware of the sexual abuse and harassment, but chose to cover up the incidents rather than try and tackle the problem.</p>, <p>The Red Cross has told media that they have forwarded the letter on to the prosecution service in Potsdam and are taking the matter very seriously.</p>, <p>The manager of the asylum home who is alleged to have been the leader in the cover up is currently on sick leave while an internal investigation has been started by the Red Cross in Potsdam. The organisation justified the move with Red Cross National Association spokesman Frank H\xfclsbeck claiming that \u201cit ensures that these employees do not enter the home until all allegations are cleared up\u201d.</p>, <p>Spokesman for the Potsdam office of the organisation, Ingo Decker, echoed the remarks of the national office saying: \u201cWe take these allegations very seriously and have invited the national office to notify us of the initial results.\u201d</p>, <p>The asylum home has also been subject of previous complaints\xa0where it was alleged that\xa0health and safety standards were severely lacking. According to those reports the employees of the home were exposed to outbreaks of diseases without being provided with adequate protection, including highly-contagious tuberculosis. The management had also insisted that workers undertake weapons searches on migrants, exposing them to potential danger.</p>, <p>While the case seems extraordinary it is not the first time asylum workers have been told to keep quiet, or have been ignored by authorities, over migrant <a href="/web/20160723163929/http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/01/20/sex-harassment-death-threats-violence-are-norm-inside-asylum-centres-says-social-worker/">sexual harassment</a> or abuse.
