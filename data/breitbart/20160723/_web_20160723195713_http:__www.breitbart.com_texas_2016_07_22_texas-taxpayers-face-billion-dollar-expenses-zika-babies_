[<p>The disease is prevalent in Central American countries, as <a href="/web/20160723165345/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/02/01/texas-health-official-urge-caution-protection-to-avoid-zika-virus/">reported</a> by Breitbart Texas.\xa0The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a travel advisory warning pregnant women to not travel to Latin and Central America \u2013 areas that have been hit hard by the disease.</p>, <p>On July 15, Breitbart Texas <a href="/web/20160723165345/http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2016/07/15/first-baby-born-texas-zika-linked-microcephaly/">reported </a>about the birth of a child in the state with the condition, the first in Texas. The condition prevents a baby\u2019s brain and head from fully developing.\xa0The director of the CDC, Dr. Tom Frieden <a href="/web/20160723165345/http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/t0404-zika-summit.html">stated</a> in April at the Zika Summit press conference that \u201ca single child with birth defects\xa0can usually cost $10 million dollars to care for or more.\u201d That figure seems to be a baseline, but using that number and multiplying it by a hundred infants born with Zika-related problems, is astronomical.</p>, <p>Dr. Frieden <a href="/web/20160723165345/http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/t0404-zika-summit.html">told</a> reporters at the press conference, \u201cThe costs are going to be terribly high through the life of that child and unfortunately some of these children aren\u2019t living very long. I think it\u2019s difficult, we don\u2019t have the experience yet to know what the life is going to be and again back to those babies that we see in the pictures from Brazil with severe microcephaly, we can see them, we know how devastated their brains are. What about the baby who was born and had placenta insufficiency, also in the same <em>New England Journal</em> paper? All of the organs were small because the placenta could not provide the nutrition required for that baby to grow normally. We don\u2019t know what the future of that baby is going to be. Then for the babies who may not even show growth problems, but may yet have unknown problems with their brain development with learning and school. We just really don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to be like, but it\u2019s very concerning, what we\u2019re seeing so far.\u201d</p>, <p>Breitbart Texas spoke with Dr. David Lakey, M.D., Chief Medical Officer at the University of Texas System. He noted that the price tag for taking care of 100 people with these types of intellectual problems and disabilities would be a billion dollars.</p>, <p>If one of these children were placed in a state-supported living center (in past referred to as a \u201cstate school\u201d), the current price per month is $15,000. If the child was placed in community-based services, a residential home with several others who have IDD (Intellectual Development Disability), the price is now $3,500 a month. \u201cIf you go out 60 years,\u201d he said, the costs for each person is $2.5 to over $10 million.</p>, <p>The costs of institutional and community care in Texas is staggering. A <a href="/web/20160723165345/https://www.dads.state.tx.us/news_info/budget/docs/dadspocketguide12-2014.pdf">2014 budget report </a>from the Texas Department of Aging and Disability Services shows that the costs to taxpayers of those in institutional facilities is\xa0$957,962,929 for the 9,168 placed there. The cost for the 37,372 individuals in community based services is\xa0$1,195,739,308. The combined cost totals\xa0$2,153,702,237 to taxpayers for just these programs.</p>, <p><a href="/web/20160723165345/http://www.cdc.gov/zika/index.html" target="_blank">According to</a> the CDC, as of July 14, 400 pregnant women in the U.S. have tested positive for Zika. Another 378 have tested positive in U.S. territories.

Most of cases were travelers who were infected when out of the country. Three of these were pregnant women. One of those infected <span lang="EN">had sexual contact with a traveler.</span></p>, <p>Health officials in Texas have tested pregnant women in Dallas and Houston who had Zika symptoms.
