[<p>\u201cWe cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore,\u201d Trump said in the polished manner of convention oratory. Trump\u2019s speech sounds much like a convention speech in tone and style, but the words and ideas are Trump\u2019s own and could not be imaginable in any other politician\u2019s formal speech. The effect here in Cleveland is galvanizing.</p>, <p>\u201cOur convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation,\u201d Trump said.</p>, <p>On Hillary Clinton, he declared, \u201cLet\u2019s defeat her in November.\u201d</p>, <p>Trump led the crowd in a chant of \u201cUSA,\u201d and the crowd called out\xa0\u201cBuild that wall\u201d during applause breaks.</p>, <p>\u201cThe crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon \u2013 and I mean very soon \u2013 come to an end,\u201d Trump stated.</p>, <p>Trump wondered who would have thought last June that \u201cWe, and I say we are a team, would have received almost fourteen million votes \u2014 the most in the history of the Republican Party and the Republican Party would get 60 percent more votes than they did eight years ago.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cTogether we will lead our party back to the White House and we will lead our country back to safety, prosperity, and peace,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe will be a country of generosity and warmth, but we will also be a country of law and order\u2026.Safety will be restored.</p>, <p>\u201cThe Democrats are holding their convention next week\u2026But here at our convention there will be no lies; we will honor the American people with the truth and nothing else.\u201d</p>]
