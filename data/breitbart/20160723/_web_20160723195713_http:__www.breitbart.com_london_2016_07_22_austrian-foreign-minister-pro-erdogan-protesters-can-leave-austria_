[<p>The failed coup in Turkey, which led to thousands taking to the streets in Vienna over the weekend, has been sharply dismissed by Austria\u2019s Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz, who joins presidential candidate for the anti-mass migration Freedom Party (FP\xd6) Norbert Hofer in <a href="/web/20160723173325/http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/07/19/tens-thousands-turks-erdogan/">denouncing </a>the action.</p>, <p>Mr. Kurz has stated\xa0that those who protested in support of the Turkish President Recep Tayyip\xa0Erdo\u011fan were \u201canything but commendable\u201d. In a new interview on Thursday the minister has gone so far as to say that Turks in Austria who want to participate in Turkish politics should leave, and the ministry summoned the Turkish ambassador over the incident,\xa0<em>Kurier</em> <a href="/web/20160723173325/http://kurier.at/politik/inland/sebastian-kurz-legt-erdogan-anhaengern-verlassen-oesterreichs-nahe/211.048.724">reports</a>.</p>, <p>\u201cWhoever wants to be involved in Turkish domestic politics, they are\xa0free to leave our country,\u201d Mr. Kurz told Austrian media via a telephone call from an anti-Islamic State conference taking place in Washington DC on Thursday. The comments are a reaffirmation of \xa0the stance of Mr. Kurz\u2019s party, the Austrian People\u2019s Party (\xd6VP), who have said they expect all Austrians of Turkish origin to behave in a manner \u201cloyal to Austria\u201d.</p>, <p>The coordination of the demonstrations is also under the microscope as some accuse Ankara and the Erdo\u011fan regime of having a hand in organising events. \xa0The issue led to the summoning of Turkish ambassador\xa0Hasan G\xf6g\xfc\u015f who has dismissed what he called \u201cbiased and unfair criticism\u201d of the <a href="/web/20160723173325/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/07/19/turkish-president-suspends-arrests-50k-plus-wake-failed-coup-attempt/">purges </a>currently ongoing in Turkey. \u201cSuch behaviour could also mean\xa0support for the rebels,\u201d he said in a letter to Austrian media in which he slammed the coverage of the coup attempt.</p>, <p>The purges have so far seen a travel ban on all Turkish academics and the suspension, firing, or imprisonment of more than 50,000 government workers, educators and armed forces members.</p>, <p>Mr. G\xf6g\xfc\u015f, however claimed that the participants in the coup will be tried \u201cby the independent judiciary in line with our international obligations and applicable law\u201d. The statement is countered by the Turkish announcement Thursday that the European Convention on Human Rights would be <a href="/web/20160723173325/http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/07/21/turkey-suspends-human-rights-convention-concerns-use-torture-emerge/">suspended</a>, despite rumours of torture of prisoners persisting.</p>, <p>\u201cWe have evidence that the demonstrations for Erdo\u011fan that have taken place in Vienna were called for directly from Turkey\u2026 and that, of course, is absolutely untenable and we want to protest against that,\u201d Mr. Kurz told Austrian broadcaster <em>ORF </em>justifying the reason for the summoning of the ambassador. The Austrian Foreign Ministry says above all they want \u201cclarity in which direction Turkey develops\u201d.</p>]
