[<p>\u201cListen, Republicans, it is so important that we come together to defeat Hillary Clinton and those race-baiting Democrats! And those Democrats will do whatever it takes to keep us Americans focusing on the colors that divide us and not the colors that unite us,\u201d the South Carolina pastor began. \u201cAnd you know why? Because she is afraid\u2026 She\u2019s afraid because she knows that together we will never allow Hillary Clinton to become the next President of the United States of America.\u201d</p>, <p>Burns, the\xa0Co-Founder and CEO of\xa0<a href="/web/20160723171040/http://thenownetwork.org/">The NOW Television Network</a>, sent a clear message to American voters and the subject of race relations.</p>, <p>\u201cI want to declare to the whole world and to the Republican Party that under Donald Trump and under a Trump Administration, all lives matter,\u201d he said to thunderous applause.</p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="557" src="/web/20160723171040if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/qLAAhoOtrv8?feature=oembed" width="990"></iframe></p>, <p>\u201cThat means black lives, white lives, Hispanic lives, Asian lives, Christian lives, Muslim lives \u2014 shout with me \u2014 all lives matter,\u201d Burns added.</p>, <p>The audience burst out in unison, chanting: \u201cAll live matter!\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cAnd, listen, let me say this,\u201d Burns said, quieting the crowd. \u201cEven though I disagree with the tactics and the divisive rhetoric of the Black Lives Matter movement, I do understand that hopelessness and lack of opportunity breeds this type of desperation.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cAnd this is true in many of our nation\u2019s ghettos and underprivileged communities,\u201d he continued. \u201cMuch of the protests in urban city centers are born out of this kind of desperation.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cBut the thing is \u2014 the way that we can solve the problem and to eliminate this kind of a desperation is to create good jobs, urban economic revitalization, and opportunities for job training and long-term solutions. That will solve the problem in our troubled cities around this country,\u201d he said to thunderous applause.</p>, <p>\u201cAnd I want to make a loud cry that we as Republicans \u2014 we are declaring right now today, that we are determined more than ever to listen to the cries of the disenfranchised, the low-income, the at-risk communities. We are more than ever \u2013 we will solve the problems together!\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cTogether. Together. Shout together!\u201d he said to the audience, leading them in a chant of the word \u201ctogether.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cAnd I know without a shadow of a doubt, that Donald J. Trump will make sure that all Americans will have jobs!\u201d</p>, <p>Leading the crowd in another chant of \u201ctogether,\u201d Burns then made\xa0an homage\xa0to the iconic closing lines of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\u2019s famous <a href="/web/20160723171040/http://kingencyclopedia.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/documentsentry/ive_been_to_the_mountaintop/">\u201cI Have Seen the Mountaintop\u201d speech</a>.</p>, <p>\u201cTogether \u2014 not as black Americans, white Americans, brown Americans, yellow Americans, or red Americans, but just as Americans, \u2014 and together as Americans, we will get to the Promised Land. And the Promised Land is a place where jobs have returned back to this country, where college degrees replace mass incarcerations, and no matter what terrorist group that tries to destroy our way of life, we will rise from the ashes! We will never die! We will always fly! And you know why? Because we are the United States of America!\u201d he said prompting another standing ovation from the crowd.</p>, <p>\u201cAnd despite the color you was born with, here in America, the only colors that matter are the colors of the red, white and blue!\u201d he shouted, as the crowd joined him in reciting the colors.</p>, <p><em>Follow\xa0Jerome Hudson\xa0on Twitter:\xa0<a href="/web/20160723171040/https://twitter.com/jeromeehudson" target="_blank">@jeromeehudson</a></em></p>]
