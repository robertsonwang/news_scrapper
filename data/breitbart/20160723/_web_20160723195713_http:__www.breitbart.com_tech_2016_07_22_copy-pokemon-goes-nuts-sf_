[<p><a href="/web/20160723164406/http://venturebeat.com/2016/07/20/pokemon-go-servers-down-for-many/">A server outage</a>\xa0on Wednesday nearly derailed the biggest gathering of monster hunters that the city\xa0has ever seen. But if anything, death by popularity should tell you just how massive the pop culture tidal wave that is <em>Pokemon Go</em>\xa0has become.</p>, <p>Armed with \u201cpokeballs\u201d fashioned from Christmas tree ornaments and a taser disguised as a <em>Pokemon</em> lure, Natasha Ashbury joined surprised organizer Sarah Witsch. Witsch had only announced the meetup via <a href="/web/20160723164406/https://www.facebook.com/events/1779733858973460/">a Facebook post the night before</a>, but <a href="/web/20160723164406/https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/11/pokemania/">8,000 people had already confirmed their attendance</a>\xa0at that point.</p>, <p>Within hours, businesses were already offering promotions based on the city crawl for pocket monsters. Several hundred mobbed the waterfront right off the bat, singing the theme song to the game-based anime and flaunting their team affiliations in a raucous demonstration of the community quickly forming around the mobile augmented reality phenomenon.</p>, <p>While the spread of starting locations \u2014 and the lack of any defined route \u2014 makes it all but impossible to gauge the precise level of participation, it\u2019s pretty obvious that <em>Pokemon Go</em> continues to gain momentum at a breakneck pace normally reserved for <a href="/web/20160723164406/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kffacxfA7G4">teenage pop sensations</a>,\xa0<a href="/web/20160723164406/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydTsiHMaOj8">weird accessories</a>, or <a href="/web/20160723164406/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPH6pleCKj0">laying on top of things</a>.</p>, <p><em>Follow\xa0Nate\xa0Church\xa0</em><a href="/web/20160723164406/https://twitter.com/Get2Church" target="_blank"><em>@Get2Church</em></a><em>\xa0on Twitter for the latest news in gaming and technology, and snarky opinions on both.</em></p>]
