[<p class="ap-story-p">In a 4-3 decision, the Supreme Court of Virginia ordered the state to cancel the registration of the more than 11,000 felons who had signed up to vote so far under the governor\u2019s April executive order. Top Republicans called it \u201ca major victory for the Constitution, the rule of law and the Commonwealth of Virginia.\u201d</p>, <p class="ap-story-p">\u201cOur nation was founded on the principles of limited government and separation of powers. Those principles have once again withstood assault from the executive branch. This opinion is a sweeping rebuke of the governor\u2019s unprecedented assertion of executive authority,\u201d House Speaker William Howell and Senate Majority Leader Thomas Norment said in a statement.</p>, <p class="ap-story-p">A spokesman for McAuliffe didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.</p>, <p class="ap-story-p">The executive order restored voting rights of felons who completed their sentences and also allowed them to run for public office, serve on a jury and become a notary public. Republican lawmakers swiftly sued, arguing that governors cannot restore rights en masse but must consider each former offender\u2019s case individually.</p>, <p class="ap-story-p">McAuliffe\u2019s administration and backers countered that there\u2019s nothing in the constitution that says \u2013 or even implies \u2013 that governors must restore a person\u2019s rights on a case-by-case basis.</p>, <p class="ap-story-p">But the Supreme Court rejected that argument Friday, calling it \u201coverstated at best.\u201d</p>, <p class="ap-story-p">Chief Justice Donald Lemons, who wrote the opinion for the court, said the claim that governors can grant blanket pardons is \u201cirreconcilable\u201d with the requirement in the Constitution that governors must report to lawmakers the \u201c\u2018particulars of every case\u2019 and state his \u2018reasons\u2019 for each pardon.\u201d</p>, <p class="ap-story-p">\u201cThis requirement implies a specificity and particularity wholly lacking in a blanket, group pardon of a host of unnamed and, to some extent, still unknown number of convicted felons,\u201d Lemons wrote.</p>]
