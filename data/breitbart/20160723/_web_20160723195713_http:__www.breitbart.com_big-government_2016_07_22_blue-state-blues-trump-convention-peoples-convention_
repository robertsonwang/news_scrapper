[<p>An elderly woman called me over to her table, where she had draped her cane across the edge. She recognized me and offered me a hug \u2014 of course! A former campaign volunteer from my <a href="/web/20160724163622/http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/Felsenthal-Files/June-2010/Alan-Dershowitz-at-fundraiser-for-Jan-Schakowsky-opponent-Joel-Pollak/">Illinois run</a>.</p>, <p>She was thrilled with the convention, she told me. She had been to several, and this was the best.</p>, <p>There was one big difference this time, she observed: fewer politicians in the delegation, and fewer bigwigs. The Senator, the Representatives, and all the other people trying to get re-elected were terrified of being associated with Trump.</p>, <p>That meant more seats on the convention floor for ordinary people \u2014 for the party grass roots, the rank-and-file, even the Tea Party activists.</p>, <p>It also meant fewer freebies. \u201cThere\u2019s no money in it this time,\u201d she said. Because the politicians weren\u2019t coming, the lobbyists stayed away.\xa0The accommodation was cheaper, the parties harder to find.</p>, <p>That suited her just fine. It was the people\u2019s turn.</p>, <p>A couple from Indiana settled in at the next table. I scanned the man\u2019s name tag for anything I might recognize. Was he some kind of official? \u201cI\u2019m a farmer,\u201d he said. \u201cCorn and soybeans. 6,000 acres.\u201d</p>, <p>That\u2019s who came to Cleveland for Donald Trump.</p>, <p>Who else came? Gay people, and young people, who packed Milo Yiannopolous\u2019s party with Breitbart on the second night of the convention, most of whom\xa0probably had never attended\xa0anything with the word \u201cRepublican\u201d in it until he came along.</p>, <p>And who else? Black people, and Hispanic people, and Jewish people, and veterans, who weren\u2019t walked across the stage in a kind of symbolic show of diversity for the cameras, but who proudly waved their Trump signs from the convention floor.</p>, <p>Who didn\u2019t come? The usual suspects \u2014 the politicians who frequent the Sunday morning shows, who rarely say anything new, and whose appearances onstage at past\xa0conventions were the\xa0equivalent of a giant \u201cintermission\u201d sign \u2014 a cue\xa0to kibbitz.</p>, <p>They thought they were helping the party by refusing to endorse Donald Trump. They were right: the convention was so much more interesting without them. We heard from, and saw, people that the party gatekeepers had kept at bay for years.</p>, <p>Donald Trump executed a hostile takeover. He saw an undervalued asset \u2014 opposition \u2014 and a failing business model.\xa0The party narrowly rejected Ted Cruz\u2019s competing bid. Thanks to both,\xa0the shareholders won. And they\u2019re not selling and walking away \u2014 at least, not most of them. They\xa0have a stake. And the hostility is fading, because the investment is paying off.</p>, <p>Trump has thrown the party wide open, raised the big tent and torn off the roof.</p>, <p>Peter Thiel sent beanie propellers spinning in left-wing Silicon Valley by daring to be gay, and proud, onstage \u2014 and by winning applause\xa0for it.</p>, <p>Ivanka Trump\xa0spoke directly to mothers who want equal pay and maternity leave \u2014 without needing or wanting the government to force someone to give it to them.</p>, <p>The families of people murdered by illegal aliens had the ear of the nation for the first time, thanks to Donald Trump.</p>, <p>As Thiel said, you don\u2019t have to agree with everything. (I don\u2019t even agree with Thiel, who took a swipe at the wars in the Middle East.) That\u2019s the point of a big tent.</p>, <p>What united everyone in the room was the fact that everyone put \u201cAmerica first.\u201d Donald Trump took that dusty old slogan,\xa0wiped away\xa0the grime of Second World War isolationism, and presented it to the nation as something new \u2014 what his friend Tom Barrack called the \u201cdiamond\u201d at the heart of the American self-image.</p>, <p>Look beyond the media filter, and the snark of social media, and talk to someone who was there. This was the people\u2019s party.</p>, <p><em>Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.
