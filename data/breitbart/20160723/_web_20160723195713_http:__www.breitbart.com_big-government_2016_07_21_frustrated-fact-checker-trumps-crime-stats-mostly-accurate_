We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore.</p>, <p>\u2026</p>, <p>Homicides last year increased by 17% in America\u2019s fifty largest cities. That\u2019s the largest increase in 25 years. In our nation\u2019s capital, killings have risen by 50 percent. They are up nearly 60% in nearby Baltimore.</p>, <p>In the President\u2019s hometown of Chicago, more than 2,000 have been the victims of shootings this year alone. And more than 3,600 have been killed in the Chicago area since he took office.</p>, <p>The number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50% compared to this point last year. Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens.</p>, <p>Mehta griped:</p>, <p>While the statistics he used were largely accurate, his conclusion was overreaching, according to independent fact checkers.</p>, <p>While there have been sharp recent increases in homicide rates in certain parts of the country, overall murder rates are the lowest they have been in decades, according to factcheck.org. Additionally, a snapshot offered by looking at a couple years is insufficient to determine whether there is a new trend.</p>, <p>In terms of specific statistics, Trump was accurate when he talked about a 17% year-over-year increase in homicides in the nation\u2019s 50 largest cities; and the murder rates in Washington, D.C., Baltimore and Chicago.</p>, <p>But he was inaccurate when he said that the number of police officer deaths has risen nearly 50% compared to the same period last year. While the number of police officers killed by guns has gone up that amount, the overall number of police officers killed in the line of duty is flat.</p>, <p>Note, in particular, Mahta\u2019s last paragraph, in which she claims that Trump said \u201cthe number of police officer deaths has risen nearly 50%.\u201d Now look again at what Trump said: \u201ckilled in the line of duty.\u201d</p>, <p><em>She corrects him for a mistake\xa0he never made.</em></p>, <p>For media \u201cfact-checkers,\u201d Republicans are presumed to be wrong, or stupid \u2014 even when they are correct.</p>, <p><em>Joel B.
