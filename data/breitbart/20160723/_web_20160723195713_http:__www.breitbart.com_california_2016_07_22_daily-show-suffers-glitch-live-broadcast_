[<p>Trevor Noah hosted Thursday night\u2019s program live from a Cleveland high school just minutes after Trump wrapped up his 76-minute speech.</p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">We\u2019re going LIVE as soon as this goddamn speech ends.</p>, <p>\u2014 The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) <a href="/web/20160723201950/https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/756330284119826432">July 22, 2016</a></p>, <p><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="/web/20160723201950js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></p>, <p>After a long segment that featured Noah delivering commentary about Trump\u2019s speech, the host introduced a clip titled, \u201cThe Very Very Incredible Deal,\u201d a mockumentary of Trump\u2019s life narrated by the Republican nominee\u2019s longtime nemesis, Rosie O\u2019Donnell.</p>, <p>\nThe very incredible life story of Donald J.

The audience\u2019s laughter also looped, appearing to confirm that <em>The Daily Show</em> uses a canned laugh track.</p>, <p>Breitbart News cannot upload the clip for copyright reasons. But the glitch has apparently been edited out of the episode posted to Comedy Central\u2019s <a href="/web/20160723201950/http://www.cc.com/full-episodes/s5l16u/the-daily-show-with-trevor-noah-july-21--2016---alex-wagner-season-21-ep-21134?xrs=synd_TWITTER_20160722_524513208_The%20Daily%20Show_Site%20Link&amp;linkId=26824797" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>, <p>Noah was just one of several late-night hosts doing live broadcasts from the Republican National Convention this week. HBO\u2019s <em>Real Time</em> host Bill Maher, TBS\u2019 Samantha Bee and CBS\u2019 Late Show with Stephen Colbert all hosted special live programs throughout the week, with <a href="/web/20160723201950/http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2016/07/18/watch-stephen-colbert-hijacks-mic-republican-national-convention-mock-trump/" target="_blank">varying degrees of success</a>.</p>, <p>Meanwhile, Noah\u2019s predecessor Jon Stewart returned to late-night this week, first appearing on Colbert\u2019s <em>Late Show\xa0</em>on CBS in a <a href="/web/20160723201950/http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2016/07/19/watch-jon-stewart-returns-late-night-tv-mock-trump/" target="_blank">pre-taped skit on Monday</a> and then delivering a searing 10-minute monologue live on Thursday night in which he mercilessly trashed Fox News pundits and Republican Trump supporters. Stewart\u2019s appearances on the program\xa0came as it has\xa0suffered through months of low ratings.</p>, <p>The Noah-led <em>Daily Show</em> has struggled to match the solid ratings and critical acclaim that Stewart\u2019s iteration of the show enjoyed for years.</p>, <p>Both Trevor Noah and Stephen Colbert <a href="/web/20160723201950/http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2016/07/14/emmys-ignore-trevor-noah-stephen-colbert/" target="_blank">failed to earn Emmy nominations this year</a>.</p>, <p><em>Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: <a href="/web/20160723201950/https://twitter.com/dznussbaum" target="_blank">@dznussbaum</a></em></p>, <p>\xa0</p>]
