[<p>The video, captured by The New American Media, shows a scuffle on the set of liberal Cenk Uygur\u2019s YouTube show, The Young Turks. Jones \u201ccrashed\u201d the set with his microphone, and a furious Uygur shouted, \u201cYou\u2019re the biggest liar in the media!\u201d Staffers shouted, \u201cGet the fuck off the stage!\u201d \u201cYou just want attention!\u201d Eventually, Uygur had to be restrained from hitting Jones.</p>, <p>Meanwhile, Dore sneaked behind the scrum, bottle in hand, and spat in Jones\u2019s face.

He did, however, retweet a fan who praised him for being a \u201cfirefighter\u201d:</p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">Can\u2019t see it too well but <a href="/web/20160723164125/https://twitter.com/jimmy_dore">@jimmy_dore</a> became a firefighter today <a href="/web/20160723164125/https://twitter.com/hashtag/FTW?src=hash">#FTW</a> in giving AJ a cold shower. <a href="/web/20160723164125/https://twitter.com/hashtag/tytlive?src=hash">#tytlive</a> <a href="/web/20160723164125/https://t.co/ixV0Uxv6cc">pic.twitter.com/ixV0Uxv6cc</a></p>, <p>\u2014 TM (@TMnFL) <a href="/web/20160723164125/https://twitter.com/TMnFL/status/756277229064192000">July 21, 2016</a></p>, <p><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="/web/20160723164125js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></p>, <p>There has been an epidemic of set-crashing at the Republican National Convention.
