[<p>Yet Kaine joined\xa0anti-Israel radicals in Congress\xa0in boycotting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s speech in March 2015 \u2014 the last plea of a beleaguered nation against an agreement that Iran is already violating with ballistic missile tests.</p>, <p>At the time, Kaine <a href="/web/20160724162232/http://forward.com/opinion/israel/216567/5-questions-for-tim-kaine-on-israel/">dismissed</a> Netanyahu\u2019s speech as purely an attempt to influence the upcoming Israel elections \u2014 on which the speech had virtually no effect \u2014 and complained that Republicans were trying to make support for Israel a partisan issue.</p>, <p>Bloomberg News at the time predicted that Kaine\u2019s decision to boycott the speech \u201ccould resonate for years,\u201d describing it as a sop to the party\u2019s left-wing base.</p>, <p>Notably, Kaine is <a href="/web/20160724162232/https://donate.jstreetpac.org/candidate/tim-kaine/">supported</a> by J Street, the George Soros-funded radical left-wing organization widely regarded as anti-Israel for its opposition to every\xa0attempt by Israel to defend itself against terror.</p>, <p>When Israel needed to be defended from an Iran deal that the Obama administration had no intent of enforcing, and that the ayatollahs had no intent of keeping, Tim Kaine joined a walkout, putting politics above principle and sound foreign policy.</p>, <p>In that regard, Kaine represents the\xa0<em>pro forma</em>, dinner-and-fundraiser definition of \u201cpro-Israel,\u201d which offers Democrats cover, and allows donors\xa0to rub shoulders with politicians, but\xa0which means little in practice.</p>, <p>Like Hillary Clinton \u2014 who was the Secretary of State when negotiations with extremist Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad began, and who supported the Iran deal to the hilt \u2014 Kaine was ultimately unwilling to heed the concerns of Israelis across the spectrum from left to right.</p>, <p>Kaine even joined the Democrats\u2019 filibuster to prevent the Senate from voting on the Iran deal at all. He co-authored the so-called \u201cCorker bill,\u201d then refused to allow the Congress exercise the barest oversight.</p>, <p>In a <a href="/web/20160724162232/http://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/kaine-statement-on-iran-deal-vote">statement</a> explaining his vote, he described himself as \u201ca strong supporter of the nuclear agreement with Iran,\u201d and called the Iran deal \u201ca dramatic improvement over the status quo.\u201d</p>, <p>Kaine\u2019s\xa0\u201cpro-Israel\u201d claims are just talk. When it counted, he was fighting on the other side.</p>, <p><em>Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.
