Fined were the New York Liberty, Phoenix Mercury and the Indiana Fever.</p>, <p>The fines were meted out for breaking league rules maintaining that uniforms cannot be altered in any way without prior permission.</p>, <p>Despite the fines, the Indiana Fever and New York Liberty conducted a <a href="/web/20160723192258/http://deadspin.com/wnba-players-continue-protests-despite-fines-stage-med-1784063758">protest</a> on Thursday that involved a refusal to answer basketball-related questions in favor of speaking out on Black Lives Matter. Liberty forward Tina Charles accepted a player-of-the-month award with her team-issued warmup gear turned inside-out.</p>, <p>The WNBA issued a statement commending the players for their \u201cpassionate advocacy.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cWe are proud of WNBA players\u2019 engagement and passionate advocacy for non-violent solutions to difficult social issues but expect them to comply with the league\u2019s uniform guidelines,\u201d WNBA President Lisa Borders said in <a href="/web/20160723192258/http://espn.go.com/wnba/story/_/id/17117125/wnba-fines-teams-players-black-warm-t-shirts" target="_blank">a statement</a> on Wednesday.</p>, <p>Indiana Fever All-Star Tamika Catchings criticized the league\u2019s decision.</p>, <p>\u201cInstead of the league taking a stance with us, where they tell us they appreciate our expressing our concerns like they did for Orlando, we\u2019re fighting against each other,\u201d she said.</p>, <p>Others insisted that the black t-shirts in support of Black Lives matter wasn\u2019t an anti-cop statement.</p>, <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a race issue, not an anti-police issue, not a black or white issue. It\u2019s a right or wrong issue,\u201d Indiana Fever player rep Briann January insisted.</p>, <p>The fine came only after the league sent an official letter to the teams reminding them of the uniform rules. The league only acted after many\xa0ignored the letter and again indulged their homage to Black Lives Matter.</p>, <p>Despite the punishment, though, player rep January warned that they will likely continue to flaunt the rules to support the race-pushing Black Lives Matter movement.</p>, <p>\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of people in our league who are very passionate about it. As a player rep we are going to continue having these conversations,\u201d January said. \u201cThe timing of them releasing the statement and giving us the papers was very timely on their part.\u201d</p>, <p><i>Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter <a href="/web/20160723192258/https://twitter.com/warnerthuston">@warnerthuston</a> or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com</i>.</p>]
