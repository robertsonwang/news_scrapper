Kaine now says, however, that \u2013 in his professional life \u2013 he is a strong advocate for abortion rights.</p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">.<a href="/web/20160724153804/https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton">@HillaryClinton</a>'s VP pick <a href="/web/20160724153804/https://twitter.com/timkaine">@TimKaine</a> earned a 100% rating on the Planned Parenthood Action Fund scorecard in the Senate.</p>, <p>\u2014 Cecile Richards (@CecileRichards) <a href="/web/20160724153804/https://twitter.com/CecileRichards/status/756643058100428800">July 23, 2016</a></p>, <p><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="/web/20160724153804js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></p>, <p>Kaine has adopted the stance common among some Catholics in public office: \u201cI\u2019m pro-life in my personal life, but support abortion in my public life.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cI have a traditional Catholic personal position, but I am very strongly supportive that women should make these decisions and government shouldn\u2019t intrude,\u201d Kaine <a href="/web/20160724153804/http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/15/politics/tim-kaine-abortion-roe-v-wade/index.html">told</a> CNN. \u201cI\u2019m a strong supporter of <em>Roe v. Wade</em> and women being able to make these decisions. In government, we have enough things to worry about. We don\u2019t need to make people\u2019s reproductive decisions for them.\u201d</p>, <p>In addition to stating that unborn babies have no constitutional rights, Clinton has vowed to work to repeal the Hyde Amendment, a longstanding federal provision that prohibits taxpayer funding of most abortions.</p>, <p>Kaine\u2019s full embrace of the pro-choice position is important since abortion will take center stage at the Democrats\u2019 convention this coming week. For the first time, the Party\u2019s platform specifically mentions its defense of Planned Parenthood, the abortion business that is being investigated by Congress for its apparent practice of selling the body parts of babies it aborts on the open market.</p>, <p>In a press release earlier this month, the Democrat convention committee said about its specific inclusion of Planned Parenthood\u2019s abortion business in the latest <a href="/web/20160724153804/https://demconvention.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/2016-DEMOCRATIC-PARTY-PLATFORM-DRAFT-7.1.16.pdf">draft</a> of its platform:</p>, <p>The platform goes further than previous Democratic platforms on women\u2019s reproductive rights.\xa0It champions Planned Parenthood health centers and commits to push back on all Republican efforts to defund it. The platform also vows to oppose, and seek to overturn, all federal and state laws that impede a woman\u2019s access to abortion, including by repealing the Hyde Amendment.\xa0It also strongly supports the repeal of harmful restrictions that obstruct women\u2019s access to healthcare around the world, including the Global Gag Rule and the Helms Amendment, which bars US assistance to other countries that provide safe, legal, abortion.</p>, <p>Planned Parenthood\u2019s president Cecile Richards noted that abortion \u2013 what her abortion business calls \u201ccomprehensive reproductive healthcare\u201d \u2013 is \u201ccentral\u201d to the Democrat Party\u2019s platform for the first time, <a href="/web/20160724153804/http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/dem-platform-digs-into-abortion-rights/article/2595606?custom_click=rss">reported</a> the <em>Washington Examiner</em>.</p>, <p>\u201cWe also applaud the platform for affirming Planned Parenthood\u2019s critical role in communities in the face of unprecedented attacks on reproductive health at the state and congressional levels, and the recognition that reproductive healthcare is core healthcare for women, men, and young people,\u201d Richards added.</p>, <p>However, pro-life members of the Democrat Party are denouncing both the platform\u2019s full embrace of abortion and vow to expand taxpayer funding of the procedure.</p>, <p>\u201cThis platform\u2019s language just says (to abortion opponents)\xa0you are no longer welcome,\u201d <a href="/web/20160724153804/http://www.wcsh6.com/news/nation-now/antiabortion-dems-outraged-by-platform-change/275329715">said</a> Kristen Day, executive director of Democrats for Life, reports <em>USA Today</em>.\xa0\u201cThis has been the general message pro-life Democrats are receiving across the country.\u201d</p>, <p>Day said the radical pro-abortion language in the platform is diminishing the size of the Democrat Party. She added that some Democrats have called her to say they will not vote for Hillary Clinton, the presumptive nominee, because of her extreme pro-abortion stance.</p>, <p>At least four Democrat U.S. senators <a href="/web/20160724153804/http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/07/19/pro-life-democrats-denounce-party-platform-fully-embracing-abortion/">claim</a> to object to their Party\u2019s radical stance on abortion: Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV), Bob Casey Jr. (D-PA), Joe Donnelly (D-IN), and Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND).</p>, <p>Fr. Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, criticized the Democratic Party\u2019s draft platform language on abortion.</p>, <p>\u201cThe Democrats\u2019 draft platform is telling loyal grassroots supporters that unless they favor totally unrestricted and taxpayer financed abortion on demand, they are no longer welcome in the party,\u201d said Pavone. \u201cApparently, it\u2019s not just the unborn whom Democratic Party leaders disrespect, but also rank and file pro-lifers and the handful of Democratic Members of Congress who vote pro-life.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cWhen Democrats controlled Congress not that long ago, there were dozens of Democrats on Capitol Hill who at least said they were pro-life,\u201d added Pavone.\xa0\u201cToday, the pro-life Democrat who supports popular measures such as the Hyde Amendment\u2026and the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act\u2026is almost extinct.\xa0 And it\u2019s not surprising.\u201d</p>]
