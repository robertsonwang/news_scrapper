[<p>On Thursday night, Trump gave a one-hour-and-fifteen-minute speech accepting the Republican nomination. The speech was so overwhelmingly well-received among the crowd that the media did not know what to do to tear it apart. Chyrons appeared on mainstream networks: \u201cTrump Accepts Nomination.\u201d Nothing scandalous.</p>, <p>CNN late-night host Don Lemon\u2019s face was distraught during his panel, as was the face of one-time Ted Cruz employee Amanda Carpenter. Lemon\u2019s show would play on the screens at public places without any sound, which was appreciated by the attendees.</p>, <p>At 12:52 a.m., this reporter texted Breitbart Washington political editor Matthew Boyle the following message: \u201c56 percent more likely to vote for Trump post speech. 75 percent positive reaction \u2013 CNN POLL!!!!!!\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cHuge write,\u201d Boyle replied.</p>, <p>The text was in reference to a CNN instant poll that was briefly displayed onscreen. The numbers were accurate, which brings up one of the problems with instant polls: mainstream media networks have to end up downplaying and throwing cold water on their own poll results when they show support for Trump.</p>, <p><a href="/web/20160723162640/http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/22/politics/donald-trump-rnc-speech-world-reacts/index.html">The CNN article</a>, \u201cWorld Reacts to Donald Trump\u2019s Acceptance Speech,\u201d reads:</p>, <p>\xa0<em>El Pais</em>, Spain\u2019s highest circulation newspaper, said Trump\u2019s speech <a href="/web/20160723162640/http://internacional.elpais.com/internacional/2016/07/22/estados_unidos/1469143063_903244.html" target="_blank">offered</a> a \u201cgrim vision of America.\u201d While the UK\u2019s <em>Daily Telegraph</em> <a href="/web/20160723162640/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/21/republican-national-convention-diary-day-4-donald-trump-to-give/" target="_blank">described</a> the speech as \u201cdeeply pessimistic\u201d and said fact-checkers were \u201chighly critical,\u201d it highlighted a CNN <a href="/web/20160723162640/https://twitter.com/oliverdarcy/status/756350235320856578" target="_blank">instant poll</a> that found that 56% of Americans who watched the speech responded positively.</p>, <p>This reporter did not happen to meet anyone from <em>El Pais</em> or the UK\u2019s <em>Daily Telegraph</em>\xa0in Cleveland at the convention \u2013 where a killer Neil Diamond cover band held court in the afternoon civic space next to the upper decks of the Indians\u2019 ballpark.</p>, <p>But CNN\u2019s report is flawed: the 56 percent number was actually the lower of two numbers. The instant poll actually showed that 75 percent of Americans had a positive view of the speech, and that 56 percent would be more likely to vote\xa0for him following the speech.</p>, <p>CNN apparently thinks so little of its own instant polling service that it buries the results in the bottom paragraphs of a tedious article citing the newspapers in Spain.</p>, <p>The mainstream press, typically, failed to integrate in any meaningful way with the actual delegates, which the delegates appreciated.</p>]
