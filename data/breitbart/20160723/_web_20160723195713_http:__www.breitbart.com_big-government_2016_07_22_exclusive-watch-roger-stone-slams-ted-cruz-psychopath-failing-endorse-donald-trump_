[<p>Jones was being interviewed by this reporter during Breitbart\u2019s live stream coverage from the RNC on Thursday. National radio host and InfoWars.com chief Alex Jones was also being interviewed in the same segment.</p>, <p><em>Watch the full interview below:</em></p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="360" id="ls_embed_1469216000" scrolling="no" src="/web/20160724155859if_/http://livestream.com/accounts/17932819/events/5856683/videos/130512190/player?width=640&amp;height=360&amp;autoPlay=false&amp;mute=false" width="640"></iframe></p>, <p>Here is a transcript of that portion of the interview:</p>, <p>STONE: Look, Ted Cruz thinks he\u2019s Ronald Reagan. And I think he miscalculated very badly. He is Nelson Rockefeller. He\u2019s the guy who bolted the party. Who deserted the party in its greatest battle. We\u2019re elephants. We have long, long memory. In four years or eight years after the Trump presidency, if this guy tries to run again, if Alex (Jones) hasn\u2019t removed him from his senate seat by then, Republicans will remember that when we went to battle he was MIA.</p>, <p>Look, the guy, he is a psychopath. He is a megalomaniac. He has an egomaniac. And he thinks he\u2019s Reagan. I guess he thought that his oratory would be so soaring that he would bring the convention to its feet.</p>, <p>JONES: Instead he was totally bood. I think this has backfired. I mean I\u2019m not just putting that as PR out. I think it\u2019s totally backfired on the whole Republican establishment.</p>, <p>STONE: And he proven that he is not a man of his word. In other words, he told the Trump people that he was supporting Trump and that he would announce he is voting Trump-Pence. And Marco Rubio did. Scott Walker did. Chris Christie did. They all ran for president. This guy broke his word. So how would anybody elect lying Ted? Because he\u2019s lied yet again.</p>, <p><b><i>Aaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.
