[<p>\u201cIt\u2019s only fitting that Hillary Clinton would select an ethically challenged insider like Tim Kaine who\u2019s personally benefited from the rigged system,\u201d Miller stated in a press release on Friday.</p>, <p>He continued:</p>, <p>While serving in government, Kaine has taken tens of thousands of dollars in freebies \u2013 more than $160,000 in fact \u2013 on free vacations, free clothes, and free tickets. If you think Crooked Hillary and Corrupt Kaine are going to change anything in Washington, it\u2019s just the opposite. They do well by the current system, while the rest of America gets left behind. The choice has never been clearer \u2013 Donald Trump calls on us to Believe in America, while the Status Quo ticket of Clinton-Kaine wants us to believe in a rigged system that enriches them at your expense.</p>, <p>Trump also blasted Kaine on Twitter, comparing him to former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell \u2014 whom Trump referred to as McDonald:</p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn't get indicted while Bob M did?</p>, <p>\u2014 Donald J.
