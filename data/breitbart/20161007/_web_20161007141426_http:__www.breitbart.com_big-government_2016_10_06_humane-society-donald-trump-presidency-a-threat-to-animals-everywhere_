Don Jr. is floated to be Interior Secretary.\u201d</p>, <p>The camera then shows photos of Trump\u2019s agricultural advisers intermingled with photos of pigs in metal stalls, a dirty puppy, and a horse. The narrator says, \u201cTrump\u2019s agricultural advisers support confining pigs, like this, allowing cruel puppy meals, even making horse slaughter legal. It\u2019s a frightening picture. A Trump presidency would be a threat to animals everywhere.\u201d</p>, <p><iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="/web/20161007073526if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/uktZk7iIgyU" width="560"></iframe></p>, <p>On September 19 <a href="/web/20161007073526/http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/09/19/donald-trump-hunting-fishing-2nd-amendment/">Breitbart News reported</a> a Trump ad in which he pledged to protect hunting and fishing, along with the Second Amendment. The ad started with Donald Jr. urging hunters to be vocal and stand up for their traditions. He warned, \u201cIf you don\u2019t start being vocal, if you don\u2019t show up and vote your conscience on these things, it\u2019s going to be gone.\u201d</p>, <p>Donald Jr. was followed by law enforcement personnel, television personalities, farmers, and celebrities. It closed with Trump saying:</p>, <p>I\u2019m so happy and thrilled to have the support of America\u2019s sportsmen and sportswomen. Hunting, fishing, and other outdoor activities are favorite pastimes across America, passed down from generation to generation. Just incredible. Law-abiding gun owners across this nation are at risk. Political correctness, Hillary Clinton, and Washington insiders are trying to take away our Second Amendment rights\u2013and they\u2019re really trying hard, like never ever before. That\u2019s wrong, and it won\u2019t happen when I\u2019m president.</p>, <p><em>AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
