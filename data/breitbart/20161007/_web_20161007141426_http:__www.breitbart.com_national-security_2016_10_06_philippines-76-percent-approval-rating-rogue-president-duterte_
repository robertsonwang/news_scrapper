[<p>According to an independent poll the Social Weather Stations group\xa0conducted at the end of September, <a href="/web/20161007175415/http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/10/06/1630924/sws-76-pinoys-satisfied-dutertes-performance">76 percent of respondents</a> gave Duterte a \u201cvery good\u201d rating in his presidency so far. \u201cBased on the survey first published by BusinessWorld, Duterte gained a +64 net satisfaction or \u2018very good\u2019 rating in the first quarter,\u201d the\xa0<em>Philippine Star</em> notes.</p>, <p>Duterte\u2019s approval rating was significantly better among men (71 percent) than women (58 percent), and did best in the region of Mindanao (85 percent approval), where he served as\xa0the mayor of Davao City for 22 years before winning the presidency.</p>, <p>\u201cThe results of the latest [SWS] survey showing a \u2018very good\u2019 net satisfaction rating for President Rodrigo Duterte shows very clearly that the majority of the Filipino people approve of his performance in his first three months in office,\u201d Duterte\xa0Communications Secretary Martin Andanar <a href="/web/20161007175415/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/manila/local-news/2016/10/06/palace-welcomes-dutertes-very-good-net-satisfaction-score-501986">said of the poll</a>.\xa0\u201cThis is not surprising at all as the President was overwhelmingly elected in the May polls on the strength of his platform of real change anchored on a strong anti-drugs, anti-crime and anti-corruption agenda.\u201d</p>, <p>CBS News notes that he won the presidential election <a href="/web/20161007175415/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/philippine-president-rodrigo-duterte-approval-brutal-drug-crackdown/">with 37.6 percent of the vote</a>, \u201cconsidered a landslide,\u201d but the large number of people who support his tenure today indicates many who did not vote for Duterte are also content with his time in office.</p>, <p>Duterte entered the presidency with high public support on June 30, according to polls. A survey taken between June 24-27, shortly before his inauguration, found that 84 percent of respondents had \u201c<a href="/web/20161007175415/http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/07/14/1602691/sws-rody-starts-presidency-excellent-trust-rating">much trust</a>\u201d in Duterte; 5 percent said they had \u201clittle trust\u201d in the political leader.</p>, <p>Many suspected Duterte would temper his infamous demeanor upon assuming the presidency. As mayor of Davao City, Duterte earned a reputation for freely using profanity in public and giving police extensive freedom to seek out suspects in drug crimes, including drug addicts. As a candidate, he continued to make inappropriate remarks in public, including <a href="/web/20161007175415/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/04/21/philippine-presidential-candidate-fire-rape-joke-cut-ties-u-s/">jokingly lamenting</a> that he was unable to have sex with a gang rape victim before the crime occurred, and that he should have been allowed to because, he said, \u201cI am the mayor.\u201d</p>, <p>Duterte threatened to cut diplomatic ties with the United States and Australia after diplomats from both countries condemned the joke. His diplomatic tenor as president has, if anything, become less subdued;\xa0he has referred to President Barack Obama as a \u201c<a href="/web/20161007175415/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/09/06/duterte-regrets-obama-son-of-a-whore-remark-but-does-not-apologize/">son of a whore</a>\u201d and said of the European Union\u2019s opposition to his zero-tolerance approach to drug crime, \u201c<a href="/web/20161007175415/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/09/21/philippine-president-eus-criticism-extrajudicial-killings-drug-suspects-f/">Fuck you</a>.\u201d</p>, <p>The SWS survey was conducted before Duterte\u2019s most recent outburst, in which he favorably compared himself to Adolf Hitler and promised he would \u201c<a href="/web/20161007175415/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/09/30/duterte-compares-hitler-id-happy-slaughter-three-million/">happily slaughter</a>\u201d three million drug addicts.

He has significantly simplified government bureaucracy, as well. \u201cHe\u2019s asked local governments to cut the time for new business registrations to two days from several weeks and automate some transactions. As of late September, more than 70 percent of 1,389 local governments surveyed were in compliance, according to Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez.\u201d</p>]
