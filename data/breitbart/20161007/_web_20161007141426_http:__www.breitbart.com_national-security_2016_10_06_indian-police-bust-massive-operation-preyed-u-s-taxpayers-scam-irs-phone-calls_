[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was an all-too-familiar scam that hit Americans with recorded messages, purportedly from the Internal Revenue Service, informing the victim that back taxes were due, and a lawsuit was imminent. The victim was encouraged to call back and arrange emergency payments to \u201csettle\u201d the IRS case. Some targets were bilked out of thousands of dollars.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="/web/20161007073533/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/a75181a766424de7afb5ce4ec9a9408c/indian-police-arrest-70-targeting-americans-tax-scam?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=AP"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Associated Press</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> quotes Mumbai police saying the scam \u201cbrought in more than $150,000 a day,\u201d which would make the operation worth almost $55 million per year.

Hundreds of hard drives, high-end servers, and other electronics have been seized.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gang had accomplices in the United States, who provided personal information on the victims, and took a 30 percent cut of the loot.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cU.S. authorities have struggled to combat an epidemic of swindlers targeting taxpayers. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, an IRS watchdog, said it has received more than 1.7 million complaints in the last three years from people reporting phone calls from swindlers impersonating IRS agents. More than 8,800 victims have paid more than $47 million as a result of these scams,\u201d the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street Journal </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">reports.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="/web/20161007073533/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/06/world/asia/india-call-centers-phone-scam-irs.html"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times</span></i></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">states that an inside informant helped to bring the Mumbai operation down\xa0after it had been up and running for about a year. Owners and operators of the scam were reportedly \u201cstunned to see the police\u201d because \u201cthey never thought that police would raid them.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <em>NYT</em> describes how the operation used cell phone text message to frighten Americans into handing over their money:</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The call center employees would send mass text messages announcing an urgent inquiry to as many as 10,000 American cellphone numbers, said Parag Manere, deputy commissioner of police in Thane, in the western state of Maharashtra.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If recipients called back, the call center employees would introduce themselves as \u201cChristopher or Daniel\u201d and speak with an American accent, impersonating I.R.S. officers.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They would then warn the victims that the local police or I.R.S. agents would raid their homes within 30 minutes unless they sent an immediate payment, said Makarand Ranade, another Thane police official.</span></p>, <p><a href="/web/20161007073533/https://www.irs.gov/uac/newsroom/scam-phone-calls-continue-irs-identifies-five-easy-ways-to-spot-suspicious-calls"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another phone scam</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported to the IRS involved threatening voice messages.
