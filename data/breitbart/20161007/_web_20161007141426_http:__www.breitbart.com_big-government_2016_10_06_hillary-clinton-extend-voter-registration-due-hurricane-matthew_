[<p>Mook made his comments on a conference call with reporters, <a href="/web/20161007073520/http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/clinton-campaign-florida-voter-registration-hurricane-229249">according to Politico</a>, and explained that the Clinton campaign expected to win the state through early voting \u2014 unless the hurricane disrupted voter registration in the last few days before the Oct. 11 deadline.</p>, <p>Politico elaborates:</p>, <p>Speaking to reporters on a conference call, Mook said Gov. Rick Scott and others should move the deadline past Tuesday so voters in the critical battleground state could register to participate in November\u2019s election in time while also staying safe as the storm that has already killed more than 100 in Haiti bears down.<br/>\nStory Continued Below</p>, <p>The request came as Mook was explaining the importance of early voting, particularly in Florida, to Clinton\u2019s White House bid.</p>, <p>Storms have played a role in previous elections. In 2012, Hurricane Sandy made landfall in New Jersey a week before Election Day. Voting procedures were affected\xa0in New Jersey and New York; more importantly, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie praised President Barack Obama\u2019s response to the storm, and embraced him on a special presidential visit to the state. Ironically, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo had declined a presidential visit out of concern that it would be too disruptive.</p>, <p>The presidential candidates have been <a href="/web/20161007073520/http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/fl/florida_trump_vs_clinton-5635.html">neck-and-neck</a> in Florida polls over the past several weeks. The infamous 2000 recount made clear how close the partisan balance is in a state that has 29 electoral votes, tied with New York for the third-highest of any state.</p>, <p>Mook\u2019s request for an extension to fit the Clinton campaign\u2019s plans recalls then-Vice President Al Gore\u2019s request for a partial recount of Florida votes in 2000, focusing only on counties where Democrats were strongest.</p>, <p><em>Joel B.
