[<p>\u201cThe Defense Department is assessing ways to strengthen eligibility criteria for training in ways that will reduce the likelihood of an individual Afghan willingly absconding from training in the U.S. and going AWOL (absent without leave),\u201d\xa0Adam Stump, a Pentagon spokesman who revealed how many ANDSF troops have gone missing, told Reuters.</p>, <p>Although other foreign troops have disappeared while training in the United States, an unnamed U.S. defense official told Reuters the frequency of ANDSF members running away was concerning and \u201cout of the ordinary.\u201d</p>, <p>According to the official, \u201cthere was no evidence any of those who had absconded had carried out crimes or posed a threat to the United States.\u201d</p>, <p>In January 2015, an Afghan soldier was <a href="/web/20161007073548/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2015/10/16/afghan-military-officer-apprehended-montana-deserting-u-s-training/">granted asylum</a> and allowed to remain in the United States despite having absconded and apprehended trying to sneak into Canada.</p>, <p>Afghan troops have gone missing on U.S. soil \u201cpresumably in an effort to live and work illegally in America,\u201d notes Reuters, citing the Pentagon.</p>, <p>The Afghan service member who was granted asylum was one of five ANDSF officers \u2014 two policemen and three soldiers \u2014 who went missing in September 2014 while participating in separate U.S.-based training programs.</p>, <p>Eventually, the two policemen were found right outside of Washington D.C., and the military officers were apprehended while trying to sneak across the Canadian border.</p>, <p>Reuters reports:</p>, <p>The military training program brings troops to the United States from around the world in order to build on military relations and improve capabilities for joint operations.</p>, <p>In some cases, officials said, the Afghan students who went missing were in the United States for elite Army Ranger School and intelligence-gathering training. The officials did not identify the missing troops or their rank.</p>, <p>Local and federal authorities, particularly the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), have been involved in <a href="/web/20161007073548/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2015/12/11/dhs-leads-search-afghan-trainees-gone-missing-ga-air-force-base/">efforts to locate</a> the missing Afghans after they are reported missing.</p>, <p>\u201cEven though the troops were in the United States for military training, they were not necessarily always on a military base,\u201d reports Reuters.</p>, <p>\u201cIf students under the military program are absent from training for more than 24 hours, they are considered to be \u2018absent without leave\u2019 (AWOL) and the Department of Homeland Security is notified,\u201d it adds.</p>, <p>The Pentagon spokesman explained that \u201cAfghans in the U.S. training program are vetted to ensure they have not participated in human rights abuses and are not affiliated with militant groups before being allowed into the United States.\u201d</p>, <p>Taliban jihadists and other terrorists have\xa0<a href="/web/20161007073548/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2015/04/08/insider-attack-afghan-soldier-kills-u-s-soldier-wounds-at-least-2-others/">occasionally infiltrated</a> the Afghan army.

The disclosure could fuel criticism by supporters of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has accused the Obama administration of failing to properly vet immigrants from Muslim-majority countries and has pledged a much tougher stance if he wins.</p>, <p>Since the Afghanistan war started in October 2001, the U.S. has invested nearly $70 billion on training and developing the ANDSF.</p>, <p><a href="/web/20161007073548/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/07/30/watchdog-afghanistan-has-lost-control-of-more-than-one-third-of-nation/">Nevertheless</a>, the Afghan troops continue to face capability gaps.
