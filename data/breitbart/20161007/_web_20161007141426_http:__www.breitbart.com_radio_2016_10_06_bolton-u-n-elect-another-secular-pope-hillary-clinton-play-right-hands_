[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI thought there was more discussion, more serious discussion, of national security issues in the VP debate than there was in the first presidential debate,\u201d said Bolton. \u201cNo thanks to the moderator, really, and no thanks to Tim Kaine of the Democratic ticket. It struck me he was going for the Ankle-Biter of the Year Award, with his approach to the debate.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cMike Pence did a great job. I think he\u2019s almost universally conceded to have been the winner, and in large part, it\u2019s because on national security he showed the kind of calm, responsible, but strong position that I think reflects the mainstream views in the Republican Party,\u201d Bolton offered, adding:</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That should give comfort, I think, to people who are still undecided at the top of the ticket, that Mike Pence is a very steady voice, and he spoke very sensibly and knowledgeably \u2013 as opposed to Tim Kaine, who, honestly, looked not just on national security, but on many fronts, like he was repeating memorized talking points, not reflecting his own thinking on some of these subjects.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bolton agreed with Marlow\u2019s contention that Tim Kaine\u2019s claim\xa0that\xa0Hillary Clinton had somehow shut down Iran\u2019s nuclear program was one of the most outrageous \u201cwhoppers\u201d of the night:</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think it shows that where his brain ought to be on national security, there\u2019s a big vacuum. I mean, this is a claim that\u2019s not even closely related to reality, and I think it really underlines one of the vulnerabilities of the Democratic ticket. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the key points I think Trump needs to make in the second and third debates: Hillary Clinton will be Barack Obama\u2019s third term. That\u2019s true on national security. It\u2019s also true on domestic issues, while we\u2019re on the subject. But for those conservatives and Republicans who have been saying, or some who have succumbed to the belief that somehow Hillary is closer to the mainstream Republican view of American foreign policy than Trump is, they really need to think again. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These kinds of vacuous statements by Tim Kaine on the Iran deal, I think underline that. That deal was a strategic defeat for the United States when it was agreed to. It hasn\u2019t gotten any better in the past year. Iran has not changed its behavior internationally. There\u2019s every reason to believe that they\u2019ve been violating the deal since before the ink was dry. We have German intelligence publishing reports already that point in that direction. We don\u2019t know how much cooperation they have with North Korea, also an aspiring nuclear power. But we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">do </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">know that Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program, out in public view, has proceeded unimpeded, and the purpose of those ballistic missiles is not to launch weather satellites; it\u2019s to launch nuclear warheads towards targets on other continents \u2013 i.e. North America.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the rosy scenario that Tim Kaine tried to portray, I don\u2019t think has any purchase in the general public, and, as I say, it should be used politically to underline the point that Hillary will be Barack Obama\u2019s third term on foreign policy.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bolton said Kaine\u2019s contention that \u201cin a lot of ways, the terror threat has decreased in the Obama years\u201d was \u201cflatly contradicted by senior officials appointed by Barack Obama\u201d:</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The director of National Intelligence, the director of the CIA, have both testified repeatedly, in open public sessions of Congress within the past few months, that the international terrorist is equal to or greater than it was on 9/11. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind that when George W. Bush left office, it was significantly lower.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It\u2019s obviously increased the spread of ISIS and other terrorist groups, the collapse of state government across North Africa and the Middle East, the descent of nearly the whole region into anarchy, the spreading number and scope of terrorist attacks in Western Europe and the United States. Really, you just have to be awake to see this; you don\u2019t have to be an intelligence expert. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I would add the claim that the terrorist threat has been reduced to the claim that the Iran nuclear deal is a big success. It\u2019s another glaring error, a glaring indication that these people don\u2019t see the world as it is, which is the absolute prerequisite for developing a foreign policy to deal with these threats and challenges.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bolton addressed the </span><a href="/web/20161007192729/http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/10/05/brussels-two-police-officers-stabbed-terror-neighbourhood-rail-station-evacuated-bomb-squad/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two terrorist attacks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Brussels on Wednesday:</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If those attacks had occurred in the United States, we would have heard them described as \u201clone wolf\u201d attacks. The description of the person would not have been made public; it just would have been a \u201cyoung male.\u201d They would not have said that he was shouting, \u201cAllahu akbar!\u201d It would have been repressed, and then it would have been explained as not something to get upset about.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact is that the terrorist threat is changing and evolving all the time, but we should not expect it at all levels to look like it\u2019s the product of a corporate decision-making process, pursuant to a nice box and line organization chart on some wall somewhere.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, what I think these individual terrorist attacks, sometimes suicide bombers, as is tragically the case in Israel, carrying explosive vests. Sometimes, it\u2019s gun attacks. Sometimes, it\u2019s knife attacks. The fact that they are random, they are unexpected, the police can\u2019t predict them to prevent them in advance, sort of like what we saw in New York and New Jersey a couple of weeks ago at the opening of the U.N. General Assembly. That shows that the terrorist threat can appear anywhere, any time. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be a city in the middle of the United States, a small town as in France. It can be in a city well removed from Paris, where a monk is killed while giving mass in a church. That is the kind of terror attack that actually inspires more fear in people because it\u2019s so unexpected. It\u2019s so unpredicted. It occurs in such unexpected places. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only way you\u2019re ever going to\xa0deal with this threat comprehensively is to treat it for what it is, which is a radical ideology that needs to be opposed as such. The United States did that twice in the twentieth century, against fascism and against communism. We can do it again. We can have allies in the Muslim world who understand that the radical Islamic terrorists are as much, or even greater, threats to them as they are to the West.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But we\u2019re not going to do it with a president who won\u2019t acknowledge the ideology, can\u2019t see it in his worldview, in any event thinks that the exercise of American power very often is more the cause of instability in the world than the cure for it.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marlow asked for Bolton\u2019s opinion, as a former U.N. ambassador, of former Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres, who is likely to be the next U.N. secretary-general.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI met with him a couple of times when I was U.N. Ambassador, right when he was beginning his tenure as the U.N. high commissioner for refugees,\u201d Bolton recalled, continuing:</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He is a former socialist Prime Minister of Portugal, a great believer in the European Union. And I recall in our first conversation, as he was heading the High Commissioner Office for Refugees, he told me how much he was worried about \u201cpopulism\u201d in the Western world \u2013 which he defined as \u201cpeople who wanted control of their own borders.\u201d And so we had, as they say, a polite exchange of views on that subject.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI think he\u2019s gonna bring that same attitude into the U.N.,\u201d Bolton predicted. He added:</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think it\u2019s possible he will be very different from Ban Ki-moon, the outgoing secretary-general, who we did elect in 2006 for the first time, precisely because we didn\u2019t think he would try to be a \u201csecular Pope,\u201d as Kofi Annan, his predecessor, had been described. I think Guterres \u2013 we\u2019ll have to see how it plays out \u2013 but I think he may be more in the model of Kofi Annan than Ban Ki-moon, which would be a problem.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said Guterres was a \u201cdone deal\u201d as secretary-general, so \u201cthe only thing we can do is elect Donald Trump because if we elect Hillary Clinton, she\u2019ll play right into his hands.\u201d</span></p>, <p><em>Breitbart News Daily</em> airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m.\xa0to 9:00 a.m.\xa0Eastern.</p>, <p><strong>LISTEN:</strong></p>, <p><iframe frameborder="no" height="400" scrolling="no" src="/web/20161007192729if_/https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F286308062&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;maxwidth=990&amp;maxheight=1000" width="990"></iframe></p>]
