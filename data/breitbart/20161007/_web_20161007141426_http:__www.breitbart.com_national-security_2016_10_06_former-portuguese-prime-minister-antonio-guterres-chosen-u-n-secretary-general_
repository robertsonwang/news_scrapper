[<p>A formal vote must still be held by the Security Council on Thursday, followed by a vote from the entire 193-member General Assembly, but nearly every source at the UN describes Guterres\u2019s confirmation as a certainty. His five-year term will begin on January 1st, succeeding Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.</p>, <p>The\xa0<em><a href="/web/20161007073540/http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-n-security-council-chooses-antonio-guterres-as-secretary-general-1475692334">Wall Street Journal</a>\xa0</em>reports Guterres was the favored candidate of the United States and Europeans but describes other members\u2019 \u201crapid coalescence around his candidacy\u201d as \u201csomething of a surprise.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cRussia, one of the council\u2019s five members with veto power, was considered the wild card in the selection process after earlier indicating it preferred the U.N.\u2019s top job go to an Eastern European for the first time. There was also considerable pressure for naming the first woman to the post,\u201d the newspaper notes.</p>, <p>After serving as Prime Minister of Portugal for seven years, the 67-year-old Guterres spent 10 years as the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. The\xa0<em>Wall Street Journal\xa0</em>describes the UN\u2019s failure to deal effectively with conflicts such as Syria and Yemen as stains on the organization\u2019s credibility, which Guterres can hopefully address.</p>, <p>\u201cWith Ant\xf3nio Guterres, the Security Council has chosen an outspoken and effective advocate for refugees with the potential to strike a radically new tone on human rights at a time of great challenges,\u201d said Louis Charbonneau, UN director for Human Rights Watch.</p>, <p>\u201cUltimately, the next U.N. secretary-general will be judged on his ability to stand up to the very powers that just selected him, whether on Syria, Yemen, South Sudan, the refugee crisis, climate change or any other problem that comes his way,\u201d Charbonneau added.</p>, <p>The <a href="/web/20161007073540/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-37576421">BBC</a> quotes Guterres saying he will \u201cserve the victims of conflicts, of terrorism, rights violations, poverty and injustices of this world.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cI have two words to describe what I\u2019m feeling now \u2013 gratitude and humility,\u201d he said from Lisbon. \u201cHumility about the huge challenges ahead of us, the terrible complexity of the modern world. But it is also humility that is required to serve the most vulnerable, victims of conflicts, of terrorism, rights violations, poverty and injustices of this world.\u201d</p>, <p>Israeli officials told the\xa0<em><a href="/web/20161007073540/http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Israeli-confidants-Guterres-friend-of-Israel-469589">Jerusalem Post</a>\xa0</em>they expected Guterres to be a \u201cfriend of Israel,\u201d citing his long relationship with former Prime Ministers Ehud Barack and Shimon Peres.</p>, <p>\u201cHe was friendly and was definitely not part of the extreme Left in Europe.\xa0I don\u2019t remember any anti-Israel comments by him. I think he will be more fair and less aggressive in the UN than his predecessors,\u201d said former Trade Minister Micha Harish.</p>, <p>\u201cI am delighted by the outcome of the Council\u2019s selection process. He will need the firm support of the Security Council as well as the wider membership of the United Nations to help him fulfill his mandate in these challenging times,\u201d said a previous Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, who now chairs The Elders, described by the BBC as \u201can independent group of global leaders.\u201d</p>, <p>Former UN Ambassador John Bolton was less complimentary of Guterres during a Thursday morning appearance on <em><a href="/web/20161007073540/http://www.breitbart.com/radio/2016/10/06/bolton-u-n-elect-another-secular-pope-hillary-clinton-play-right-hands/">Breitbart News Daily</a>:</em></p>, <p>He is a former socialist Prime Minister of Portugal, a great believer in the European Union. And I recall in our first conversation, as he was heading the High Commissioner Office for Refugees, he told me how much he was worried about \u201cpopulism\u201d in the Western world \u2013 which he defined as \u201cpeople who wanted control of their own borders.\u201d And so we had, as they say, a polite exchange of views on that subject.</p>, <p>Kofi Annan figured in Bolton\u2019s critique of Guterres:</p>, <p>I think it\u2019s possible he will be very different from Ban Ki-moon, the outgoing secretary-general, who we did elect in 2006 for the first time, precisely because we didn\u2019t think he would try to be a \u201csecular Pope,\u201d as Kofi Annan, his predecessor, had been described. I think Guterres \u2013 we\u2019ll have to see how it plays out \u2013 but I think he may be more in the model of Kofi Annan than Ban Ki-moon, which would be a problem.</p>, <p><a href="/web/20161007073540/https://www.yahoo.com/news/antonio-guterres-tireless-refugee-champion-180054742.html">AFP</a> describes Guterres as \u201can engineer by training and fervent Catholic\u201d who has been a \u201ctireless refugee champion.\u201d He is anti-abortion, having permitted a referendum to change Portugal\u2019s strict abortion law in 1998 but received neither credit nor blame for its failure.</p>, <p>\u201cWhen people say they cannot receive Syrian refugees because they are Muslims, those that say it are supporting [<em>sic</em>] terrorist organisations and allowing them to be much more effective in recruiting people,\u201d AFP quotes him saying in December.</p>, <p>Guterres was indeed a member of the Socialist party in Portugal, in fact, its Secretary-General in the nineties. AFP notes one of his \u201cflagship measures\u201d was establishing a guaranteed minimum income. The Socialists suffered at the polls when the economy began to decline, and Portugal is now viewed as a prospect for Europe\u2019s <a href="/web/20161007073540/http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-portugal-could-be-europes-next-economic-disaster-2016-08-24">next great economic disaster</a>.</p>]
