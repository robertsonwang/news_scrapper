[<p>The Alabama Republican adds that he thinks the Senate should investigate how the FBI granted immunity to Clinton Foundation director Cheryl Mills and destroyed evidence under congressional subpoena.</p>, <p>\u201cI was a U.S. attorney and an assistant U.S. attorney before that and I have been through a lot of these issues,\u201d Sessions says.</p>, <p>Sessions said when he was a Department of Justice lawyer, he worked regularly with FBI agents and he was always impressed by their professionalism and their apolitical approach to their work.</p>, <p>\u201cI love the FBI,\u201d he said.</p>, <p>But, now after witnessing the extraordinary handling of evidence, witnesses involved in the scandal surrounding Hillary Clinton\u2019s\xa0private email scheme and her handling of classified electronic correspondence, he is forced to reassess, he said.</p>, <p>Clinton is the Democratic nominee for president and Comey announced July 5 that he was recommending to the Department of Justice that she not be prosecuted in regard to the scandal.</p>, <p>\u201cThis is scary to me,\u201d Sessions tells Carr. \u201cI tried not to be critical of Comey at first.\u201d</p>, <p>Sessions said the more he learns about Comey and the FBI\u2019s operating outside of the bureau\u2019s regular practices, the more concerned he becomes.</p>, <p>While the House of Representatives has made an effort to investigate Comey and the FBI\u2019s behavior in the Clinton email scandal, the Senate needs to get involved also, he said.</p>, <p>Central to the FBI\u2019s mismanagement of the scandal investigation is their preferential treatment of Mills, he said. Mills was Clinton\u2019s chief of \xa0staff at the State Department, an attorney in the administration of her husband President William J. Clinton and is now <a href="/web/20161007194923/https://www.clintonfoundation.org/about/board-directors#CherylMills">a\xa0member of the Clinton Foundation\u2019s board of directors</a>.</p>, <p><a href="/web/20161007194923/https://howiecarrshow.com/">Howie Carr </a>asked Sessions how is it that the former first lady could have Mills treated by the FBI and the Department of Justice as her attorney, while Clinton also had <a href="/web/20161007194923/https://www.wc.com/">another team of lawyers from Williams and Connolly</a>.</p>, <p>The efforts to cover up and protect everyone involved in the email scandal were blatant, Carr said.\xa0\u201cRichard Nixon never dreamed of doing things like this.\u201d</p>, <p>The Alabama senator said that benefit given to Mills was not justified.</p>, <p>\u201cIt is really unhealthy,\u201d the senator said.</p>, <p>\u201cShe should not be treated as a legitimate lawyer\u2013she surely had a conflict of interest,\u201d he said.\xa0As it is understood in the Common Law, <a href="/web/20161007194923/https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/attorney-client_privilege">attorney-lawyer privilege</a> protects communications between a lawyer and his client. But, <a href="/web/20161007194923/https://lawyerist.com/81438/difference-confidentiality-attorney-client-privilege/">there are limits</a> on the privilege, so that it cannot be used to obstruct an investigation into a past or ongoing crime.</p>, <p>Mills and the FBI set up an investigation process, where Mills was in a position to know everything that was going on as both a potential target, witness and attorney, who was granted privilege with other targets and witnesses and allowed to attend interviews between the FBI and other potential targets and witnesses.</p>, <p>Sessions told Carr:\xa0\u201cI don\u2019t see how it is possible for someone so involved in a case that they refuse to provide testimony and information without a grant of immunity.\u201d</p>, <p>Mills must know she is in legal jeopardy, he said.</p>, <p>\u201cThat suggests that they think a truthful and or a truthful production of documents could incriminate them\u2013and then, she turns around and is the lawyer for another possible co-conspirator in this activity?\u201d he asked.</p>, <p>\u201cIt is a breathtaking thing,\u201d the senator said.</p>, <p>Sessions said Mills, who was Clinton\u2019s chief of staff at the State Department, then was granted attorney-lawyer privilege in regards to relationship with Clinton and was allowed to participate in FBI interviews with other individuals involved in the email scandal.</p>, <p>\u201cI really don\u2019t see how Congress can issue a subpoena for records and they then destroy those records,\u201d he said.</p>, <p>\u201cI am telling you that every business knows that if they get a subpoena for business records, and they destroy those records, they are subject to criminal prosecution and will be prosecuted,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cThat\u2019s a high prosecution case.\u201d</p>]
