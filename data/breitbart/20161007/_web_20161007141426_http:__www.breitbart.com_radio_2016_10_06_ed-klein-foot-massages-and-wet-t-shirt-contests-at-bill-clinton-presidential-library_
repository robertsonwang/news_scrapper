[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking with Breitbart Editor-in-Chief and SiriusXM host Alex Marlow, Klein said his new book \u201cmay sound like an easy read,\u201d but he conducted \u201ca huge amount of research\u201d for it, including \u201cwell over two, three hundred interviews.\u201d</span></p>, <p><strong>LISTEN:</strong></p>, <p><iframe frameborder="no" height="166" scrolling="no" src="/web/20161007194946if_/https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/286308691&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false" width="100%"></iframe></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cAnd then of course, as Nora Ephron, the now late Nora Ephron used to say, \u2018all good writing is rewriting,\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cSo this book has gone through my computer many, many times. If it\u2019s a thriller, it\u2019s because I\u2019ve really tried to make it accessible \u2013 make this book </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guilty as Sin </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">accessible to a large audience, because the message is very important.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Klein said that message, as the title makes clear, is: \u201cHillary </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">guilty as sin, has been guilty as sin, and if she becomes president, you can bet your bottom dollar that her four years will be one Hillary Clinton scandal after another, because wherever they go, the Clintons trail scandal behind them.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Klein reviewed his history as a writer and editor, describing how he was ostracized from mainstream media after he began reporting extensively on the Clintons:</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I was at the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and that\u2019s a long time ago \u2013 I left the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">believe it or not, in 1988 \u2013 back then, the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">it\u2019s hard to remember, it was a straight newspaper. It was not in the tank for the Democratic Party. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a straight newspaper because the executive editor of the paper, Abe Rosenthal, had a famous saying: \u2018I don\u2019t care if you cover the circus, as long as you don\u2019t sleep with the elephants.\u2019 He meant by that, obviously, that you could cover the Democratic Party, that\u2019s fine, but you can\u2019t get into bed with these people. You have to have fairness, and distance, and detachment. That\u2019s the way it used to be, and that\u2019s the way I was, when I was there.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, when I write about Hillary, and Bill, and the Clintons, and what they have been up to in this new book </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guilty as Sin, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am bringing the same journalistic ethics to bear. These are facts in this book, and the facts speak for themselves \u2013 which is that Hillary in fact did jeopardize national security with her unsecure email server; that Barack Obama knew about it all along during her time as Secretary of State and didn\u2019t do anything about it, so he was complicit in this; that she and Bill Clinton don\u2019t even live in the same city, no less in the same house; and that Bill has his own little love nest down in Little Rock, in his library.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Klein is well aware his findings will be challenged because he used anonymous sources. \u201cYou can\u2019t write contemporary political books without using anonymous sources because people won\u2019t talk to you otherwise,\u201d he said, noting the mainstream press has few qualms about the technique when anonymous sources provide information damaging to Republicans.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marlow asked him to elaborate on Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential library, which </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guilty as Sin </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">describes as effectively a \u201cbachelor pad.\u201d </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Klein <span style="font-weight: 400;">claimed Clinton wanted to add a swimming pool to his already \u201cluxurious\u201d accommodations, but had to settle for foot massages and impromptu wet T-shirt contests when his request was denied:</span></span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, basically, the national media has ignored Bill Clinton down in Little Rock, where he spends almost half his time. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I went down there, and I interviewed two interns who worked there, and they were in their twenties. Both of them had been invited up to his penthouse apartment on the fifth floor of the William Jefferson Clinton Library, where he has his luxurious penthouse apartment that he uses for parties. Both of them have given Bill Clinton foot massages, no less. He kicks off his loafers and his socks, and they massage his feet.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, he planned, and had an architect look into, building a swimming pool up there on the fifth floor, so that he could have naked pool parties, the way John F. Kennedy, his hero, used to have in the White House. And the National Archives said no way, we\u2019re not going to\xa0let you do that, so it never came to fruition. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But he </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">does, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to a source that I have who was at one of these parties with him, take out a garden hose from time to time and spray down these women, in kind of a wet T-shirt contest.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ed Klein\u2019s blog and newspaper work can be found at his website, </span><a href="/web/20161007194946/http://edwardklein.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EdwardKlein.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guilty as Sin </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is now available from retailers such as </span><a href="/web/20161007194946/https://www.amazon.com/Guilty-Sin-Uncovering-Corruption-Investigation/dp/1621576418/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1475762789&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=guilty+as+sin"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="/web/20161007194946/http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/guilty-as-sin-edward-klein/1124671616?ean=9781621576419"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barnes &amp; Noble</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>, <p><em>Breitbart News Daily</em> airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m.\xa0to 9:00 a.m.\xa0Eastern.</p>, <p>Listen to the <a href="/web/20161007194946/https://soundcloud.com/breitbart/breitbart-news-daily-ed-klein-october-6-2016">full interview audio</a> above.</p>]
