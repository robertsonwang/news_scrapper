Any navigational error could have resulted in the group being stranded on their rudimentary vessel in the middle of the Caribbean as the storm passed over them, likely resulting in their deaths.</p>, <p>Hurricane Matthew <a href="/web/20161007182035/http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/cuba/article106077412.html">landed in Cuba on Tuesday</a>, devastating the easternmost point of Baracoa, as a Category 4 hurricane. The images of the devastation have begun to surface, showing centuries-old buildings in utter collapse and distraught residents digging through rubble for their belongings. The hurricane caused more damage in Haiti, where it killed dozens and has forced the government to postpone an upcoming election.</p>, <p>Hurricane Matthew is <a href="/web/20161007182035/http://www.reuters.com/article/us-storm-matthew-idUSKCN1250G2">expected to make landfall</a> in Florida on Thursday, potentially impacting 12 million people throughout the American South:</p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">Hurricane Matthew leaves a trail of destruction in Cuba <a href="/web/20161007182035/https://t.co/bven6Tb3nt">https://t.co/bven6Tb3nt</a> <a href="/web/20161007182035/https://t.co/TKch5P6n03">pic.twitter.com/TKch5P6n03</a></p>, <p>\u2014 Los Angeles Times (@latimes) <a href="/web/20161007182035/https://twitter.com/latimes/status/783720382561972224">October 5, 2016</a></p>, <p><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="/web/20161007182035js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></p>, <p>\nCuba picks up the pieces after being battered by Hurricane Matthew <a href="/web/20161007182035/https://t.co/gF6FVV6DcQ">https://t.co/gF6FVV6DcQ</a> <a href="/web/20161007182035/https://t.co/Q8jd4j0m8u">pic.twitter.com/Q8jd4j0m8u</a></p>, <p>\u2014 Daily Mail US (@DailyMail) <a href="/web/20161007182035/https://twitter.com/DailyMail/status/783675049886769157">October 5, 2016</a>\n</p>, <p><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="/web/20161007182035js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></p>, <p>The routes out of Cuba to Florida and Central America for those seeking escape from the communist dictatorship there are highly dangerous, even without the presence of a major storm, yet Cubans have increasingly braved the journey following President Barack Obama\u2019s announcement in December 2014 that he would engage in a diplomatic \u201cnormalization\u201d with dictator Ra\xfal Castro.</p>, <p>In January 2016, little more than a year since President Obama announced his concessions to the Castro regime and two months before his visit to the island, a first since the tenure of Calvin Coolidge, the U.S. Coast Guard confirmed to Breitbart News that they had documented <a href="/web/20161007182035/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/01/21/cuban-refugees-drinking-bleach-jumping-overboard-at-sight-of-u-s-coast-guard/">a 350 percent spike</a> in the \u201coverall Cuban migrant flow\u201d to the United States through the Caribbean between 2010 and 2016, but a 23 percent increase in the number of refugees recovered at sea between January 2015 and January 2016.</p>, <p>By July 2016, U.S. Customs and Border Protection <a href="/web/20161007182035/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/07/20/obama-normalization-policy-prompts-500-percent-spike-cuban-refugees/">reported a 500 percent increase</a> in Cuban refugee flows into the United States between 2011 and 2016.
