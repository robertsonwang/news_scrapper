[<p>\u201cIn the beginning, God\u2026\u201d are the first words out of Robertson\u2019s mouth in the introduction of <em>Torchbearer</em>, saying that this God is the creator of heaven and earth, is as relevant today as in the beginning, and sounds a prophetic call that Christians in America today may be on the edge of the precipice that leads to difficult trials, and perhaps even the same persecution that Christians have faced across the world for twenty centuries.</p>, <p>Thus begins a new documentary shining a spotlight on the growing anti-Christian sentiments in America that are pushing popular culture and public policy away from historical Judeo-Christian moorings, and moving rapidly in the direction of open hostility. Ultimately, Robertson explains that this is just the latest chapter in a conflict spanning two millennia, described by Augustine of Hippo as the City of Man in opposition to the City of God.</p>, <p><em>Torchbearer</em>\u2014directed by Stephen K. Bannon, produced by Bannon and David Bossie, and written by Bannon, Zach Dasher, and Breitbart News Senior West Coast Editor Rebecca Mansour\u2014gives the viewer a whirlwind tour of world history with a focus on the Christian experience from apostolic times to the present, showcasing the pattern of how godless humanity descends into depravity, in stark contrast to the sublime virtues with which God\u2019s people adorn their lives in the face of adversity\u2014all narrated in the iconic voice of the Duck Commander.</p>, <p>Torchbearer\u2019s <a href="/web/20161007194335/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPYgGiI1nxU">trailer</a> takes the viewer on a <a href="/web/20161007194335/http://www.breitbart.com/radio/2016/05/12/phil-robertson-depravity-has-become-mainstream-america-must-turn-to-god/">global odyssey</a> from the Areopagus in Athens, to St. Peter\u2019s Square and the Coliseum Rome, to countless rows of white crosses in Normandy, to a jail cell in Birmingham. The full documentary delves deep into each of these venues and more, in a movie that is simultaneously fast-paced yet thought-provoking.</p>, <p>\u201cSocial Darwinism. Survival of the fittest.\u201d That is how Robertson summarizes a godless view of human existence, explaining that if there is no higher being to whom man is accountable, the motto becomes, \u201cMight makes right.\u201d</p>, <p>Regimes based upon a worldview that rejects God\u2019s authority become violently hostile to those who peacefully live out biblical faith. Ancient Rome was the first example of this after the death and resurrection of Christ, as Christians would not join the new cult of emperor worship. \u201cChristians did not mind praying <em>for</em> the emperor, but they would not pray <em>to</em> the emperor,\u201d Robertson explained.</p>, <p>When ordered to offer a small pinch of incense as a sign of worship to the Roman emperor, Christians went willingly to their deaths instead\u2014and were slaughtered <em>en masse</em>.</p>, <p>Pivoting to those people, Robertson explains that God is \u201cthe creator of all things. God created man and woman in his image. We are image-bearers of God.\u201d</p>, <p>However, \u201conce you forget where your rights come from\u2026 oh my goodness,\u201d Robertson sighs. He lays out \u201can indictment of the human race,\u201d quoting from Romans 1:28, \u201cSince they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done.\u201d</p>, <p><em>Torchbearer</em> links respect for human rights and a willingness to defend human dignity to faith in God, focusing on the selfless works of service and charity earnestly carried out by countless people of faith.</p>, <p>The film also explores the price that countless Christians have paid for their commitment to follow Jesus Christ, beginning with the martyrdom of the apostles Peter and Paul.</p>, <p>Stories like these do not merely belong in the past, however, or found solely overseas. Although punishments here have not yet come close to being violent, observant Christians in America are suffering lesser forms of punishment for declining to offer a pinch of incense to the emperor, consequences that are increasing both in frequency and in severity.</p>, <p>Just in the past few years:</p>, <p>In fact, several of these cases arose just in the past year, and some are still in court today, or are about to go to court. And these are only a fraction of the current struggles going on in America involving observant Christians and people of other faiths.</p>, <p>I should know.
