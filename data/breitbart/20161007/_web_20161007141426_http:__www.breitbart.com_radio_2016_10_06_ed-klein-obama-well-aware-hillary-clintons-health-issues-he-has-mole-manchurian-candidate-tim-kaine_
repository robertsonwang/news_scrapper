[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marlow said he thought the most important of the book\u2019s many detailed chapters concerned \u201cthe palace intrigue\u201d between the Obamas and Clintons, including the revelation that the Obamas \u201cwere well aware of Hillary Clinton\u2019s health issues.\u201d </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Marlow put it, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guilty as Sin </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">suggests Clinton\u2019s shaky health was one of the reasons the Obamas supported her because \u201cthey think they could perhaps have another shadow presidency.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Klein said this palace intrigue was \u201cvery interesting because you know there was a blood feud between the Obamas and the Clintons \u2026 but after Barack Obama was unsuccessful in getting Joe Biden or Elizabeth Warren, the looney-tunes senator from Massachusetts, to run for president \u2013 and he tried very hard to get one or the other \u2013 he was stuck with Hillary Clinton.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He explained how Obama has taken steps to guarantee his influence within a Clinton White House:</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It\u2019s either Hillary wins or Donald Trump wins, and if Donald Trump wins, obviously, Obama\u2019s legacy is gonna get wiped out, including Obamacare and a lot of other things. So he\u2019s thrown in his lot now with Hillary, but he\u2019s aware of the fact \u2013 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">keenly </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aware of the fact \u2013 that Hillary\u2019s health is very frail. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He, in fact, offered her the use of the Walter Reed National Medical Center to have a checkup. He said he\u2019d let her get in there secretly and nobody would know about it, but she said, \u201cNo, thank you\u201d because she has her own doctors in New York City, where she goes periodically for checkups, for what I\u2019m told is a leaky heart valve.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He, Obama, was very instrumental in persuading Hillary to tap Tim Kaine as her running mate. And the reason for that is that Tim Kaine, who used to be a Clinton loyalist many years ago when he was governor of Virginia, backed Obama in 2008 against Hillary during the primaries. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So he is an Obama man, Tim Kaine, not a Clinton man. And so if Hillary should falter because of her health in the White House, if she\u2019s elected, the Obamas have what you might call a mole, or a Manchurian candidate, or whatever you want to call Tim Kaine, there so that they can have huge influence over the course of this country and the Democratic Party.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Klein noted that Obama is \u201crenting this </span><a href="/web/20161007194702/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/obamas-rent-mansion-leaving-white-house-article-1.2649843"><span style="font-weight: 400;">huge home</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Kalorama section of Washington,\u201d which he thinks has \u201ceight bedrooms, and there\u2019s room for Valerie Jarrett there. It has room for ten cars, and that\u2019s very unusual in Washington.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThis is kind of a second White House in Washington, with Obama, with clear intention of continuing his influence over the course of this country in the next presidency,\u201d Klein said.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marlow offered some parting thoughts about the importance of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guilty as Sin, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">building from Klein\u2019s point about the interconnectedness of the Clinton and Obama power structures in Washington</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></i></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the highlights for me was talking about how Hillary is too big to fail, too big to jail. Going into just the detail of how many people would suffer if Hillary Clinton was indicted, and you realize it\u2019s all the cronyism; it\u2019s all the corporatism. She got out of getting more scrutiny because the more scrutiny she\u2019s under, the more it hurts the Obamas, the more it hurts the other people in power. That\u2019s the math. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And you have a choice, ladies and gentlemen of the American public: you can reject it, or you can accept it. You can accept the Clintons, or you can think we\u2019re gonna go a third way. We\u2019re gonna start fresh, where everyone isn\u2019t in bed with each other in Washington, D.C.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ed Klein\u2019s blog and newspaper work can be found at his website, </span><a href="/web/20161007194702/http://edwardklein.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EdwardKlein.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guilty as Sin </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is now available from retailers such as </span><a href="/web/20161007194702/https://www.amazon.com/Guilty-Sin-Uncovering-Corruption-Investigation/dp/1621576418/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1475762789&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=guilty+as+sin"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="/web/20161007194702/http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/guilty-as-sin-edward-klein/1124671616?ean=9781621576419"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barnes &amp; Noble</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>, <p><em>Breitbart News Daily</em> airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m.\xa0to 9:00 a.m.\xa0Eastern.</p>, <p><strong>LISTEN:</strong></p>, <p><iframe frameborder="no" height="400" scrolling="no" src="/web/20161007194702if_/https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F286308691&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;maxwidth=990&amp;maxheight=1000" width="990"></iframe></p>]
