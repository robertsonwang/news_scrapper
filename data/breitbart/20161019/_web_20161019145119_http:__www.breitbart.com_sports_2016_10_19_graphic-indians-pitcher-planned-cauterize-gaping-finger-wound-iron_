[<p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>It\u2019s no secret that the Indians yanked starter Trevor Bauer after two outs in Game 3 against the Blue Jays Monday night. Bauer had\xa0<a href="/web/20161220235850/http://deadspin.com/trevor-bauers-sliced-up-pinkie-is-extremely-gross-1787904424">horrifically mauled his finger while fixing his drone,</a> and the bleeding which began almost as soon as he started pitching couldn\u2019t be contained. Resulting in Indians skipper Terry Francona having to pull him from the game.</p>, <p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>Here\u2019s what Bauer\u2019s finger looked like prior to the game:</p>, <p><a href="/web/20161220235850/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/10/Trevor-Bauer-pinkie-1.jpg"><img alt="Trevor Bauer pinkie 1" class="alignnone wp-image-5304317 size-full" height="450" src="/web/20161220235850im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/10/Trevor-Bauer-pinkie-1.jpg" width="800"/></a></p>, <p>Here\u2019s the finger during the game:</p>, <p><a href="/web/20161220235850/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/10/Trevor-Bauer-pinkie-2.jpg"><img alt="Trevor Bauer pinkie 2" class="alignnone wp-image-5304332 size-full" height="448" src="/web/20161220235850im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/10/Trevor-Bauer-pinkie-2.jpg" width="800"/></a></p>, <p>What\u2019s less well known is that Bauer, according to Yahoo!\u2019s Jeff Passan, considered some pretty barbaric lengths to close the wound before the game.</p>, <p>According to <a href="/web/20161220235850/http://deadspin.com/trevor-bauer-considered-cauterizing-his-gross-finger-wi-1787948638?utm_campaign=socialflow_deadspin_twitter&amp;utm_source=deadspin_twitter&amp;utm_medium=socialflow">Deadspin:</a></p>, <p>Bauer told Passan that he repeatedly bugged the Indians\u2019 medical staff to cauterize his finger wound shut with a soldering iron. They laughed at him, but Bauer was 100 percent serious. He truly wanted his already mangled finger to be burnt shut so bad he almost performed the procedure himself.</p>, <p>\u201cI even had a soldering iron in my hotel room,\u201d Bauer said. \u201cInstead of going to the ER, I probably should\u2019ve sealed it closed myself.\u201d</p>, <p>A Reddit user who purportedly tried this said, \u201cMight take longer, but it gets the job done.\u201d Despite that compelling testimony, no, Bauer should not have sealed it closed himself. Cauterization is only necessary in a life-or-death scenario, per Stuff You Should Know. You can burn yourself (duh) or expose yourself to nasty infections.\u201d</p>, <p>Your move Ronnie Lott.</p>, <p>@themightygwinn</p>]
