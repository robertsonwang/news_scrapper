[<p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>During his speech, Bill Clinton drew\xa0a stark contrast between his wife\u2019s campaign slogan of \u201cStronger Together\u201d and her Republican opponent\u2019s slogan of \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d</p>, <p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>\u201cThat slogan is not just about politics. It\u2019s about a way of thinking and a way of living. And I really believe that\u2019s what this is about,\u201d Clinton said of his wife\u2019s campaign slogan.</p>, <p>\u201cI know what \u2018great again\u2019 means,\u201d Clinton said, referring to his upbringing in the rural south. \u201cIt means vote for me and I will make all your problems go away by giving you the economy you used to have, and oh, by the way, I will move you back up to the first spot on the social totem pole.\u201d Bill Clinton went on to say that \u201cHillary Clinton would do away with the social totem pole entirely.\u201d</p>, <p>In keeping with the\xa0upbeat message he gave Monday during his New Hampshire campaign stops, Bill Clinton promised, \u201cA second Clinton presidency would end gridlock in Washington.\u201d However,\xa0he did recognize that Hillary Clinton, as president, would face an uphill battle to reach that goal. Monday, Hillary Clinton\u2019s favorite Republican, Sen. John McCain, vowed that Republicans would block anyone Hillary Clinton nominates to the Supreme Court.</p>, <p>During an odd moment in his speech, Bill Clinton said, \u201cI\u2019ve tried to run for her on her behalf when I\u2019ve gone around on my little bus tours around rural Iowa and rural Ohio, and I\u2019m gonna do one in western Pennsylvania. I\u2019m about to go to north Florida and do one.\u201d</p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="557" src="/web/20161020201104if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/YuFsBTw0DrE?feature=oembed" width="990"></iframe></p>, <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton is currently preparing for the final debate Wednesday night in Las Vegas.
