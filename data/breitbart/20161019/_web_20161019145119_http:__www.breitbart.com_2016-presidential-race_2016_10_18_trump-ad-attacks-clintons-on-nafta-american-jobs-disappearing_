From NAFTA to TPP to shipping our jobs offshore to China, this is the economic disaster of our time. It\u2019s a politician-made disaster with the names of Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama all over it. We can\u2019t afford any more of Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u2018leadership\u2019 on this issue. Donald Trump on the other hand has a plan to cut taxes, reduce regulations, crack down on the trade cheaters, and renegotiate every bad Clinton trade deal in order to put American workers first.</p>, <p>Republican president George H.W Bush first negotiated NAFTA and Democratic President Bill Clinton pushed for the passage of NATFA in 1993 with a Democrat-controlled Congress, signing it into law in December 1993. \u201cNAFTA is still controversial but people will thank me for it in 20 years,\u201d Bill Clinton <a href="/web/20161020173415/http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/bill-clinton-trump-nafta-228795">said</a> last November. Critics have pointed out NAFTA\xa0stripped manufacturing out of the U.S. interior and <a href="/web/20161020173415/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/07/us/twenty-years-later-nafta-remains-a-source-of-tension.html">encourages</a>\xa0illegal immigration, particularly from Mexico. Both ruling class\xa0families are, of course, vehemently anti-Trump.</p>, <p>Economic Policy Institute researcher\xa0Robert E. Scott\xa0<a href="/web/20161020173415/http://www.epi.org/blog/fast-track-to-lost-jobs-and-lower-wages/">wrote</a>:</p>, <p>Between 1993 (before NAFTA took effect) and 2013, the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico and Canada increased from $17.0 billion to $177.2 billion, <a href="/web/20161020173415/https://ideas.repec.org/a/elg/rokejn/v2y2014i4p429-441.html">displacing more than 850,000 U.S. jobs</a>.\xa0Growing trade deficits and job displacement, especially between the United States and Mexico, were the result of a surge in outsourcing of production by U.S. and other foreign investors. The rise in outsourcing was fueled, in turn, by a surge in foreign direct investment (FDI) into Mexico, which increased by more than 150 percent in the post-NAFTA period.</p>, <p>Clinton will talk in <a href="/web/20161020173415/http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/14/politics/hillary-clinton-trade/">glowing terms</a> about NAFTA when writing memoirs but criticize it when she runs for office in order to placate progressive labor allies.
