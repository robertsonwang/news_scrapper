Hell no. This whole system is criminal. This event is promoting a racist, fascist, xenophobic agenda. Illegal immigrants are not the real criminals. The criminals are this country and the entire system that feeds on the exploitation and people of the world.\u201d</p>, <p>Durden quickly took offense to the protester\u2019s action, citing her disappoint that they wouldn\u2019t treat her and the memory of her son with respect. \u201cI don\u2019t mind anything you have to say, whether if you agree with me or not, but it\u2019s incredibly hard to be here and talk about my son,\u201d Durden said. \u201cI expect you guys to be somewhat respectful.\u201d</p>, <p>Although the event was chaotic, Durden was able to get across her major points. \u201cThe undocumented community are criminals by law,\u201d Durden pushed. \u201cYou have to take care of your own first before you can take care of others. So if I take care of my American people that have a right to be here first, and we have enough American criminals. We don\u2019t need new criminals that aren\u2019t even supposed to be here.\u201d</p>, <p><em><em>Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about Free Speech and Intellectual Diversity for Breitbart.
