Truth is dangerous especially when it challenges power.\u201d</p>, <p>This second investigation features an undercover Project Veritas reporter posing as a Democratic Party donor brainstorming an elaborate voter fraud scheme to fraudulently register people to vote in various states using the lax voter registration policies currently in place.</p>, <p>Like O\u2019Keefe\u2019s <a href="/web/20161018235930/http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/17/exclusive-okeefe-video-sting-exposes-bird-dogging-democrats-effort-to-incite-violence-at-trump-rallies/">first video</a>, the second also prominently features Democratic operatives Robert Creamer and his colleague Scott Foval, who <a href="/web/20161018235930/http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/17/james-okeefe-gets-another-scalp-subject-undercover-video-ousted/">was removed from his position</a> at the leftwing advocacy group Americans United for Change on Monday as a result of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s investigation. O\u2019Keefe notes that at the time the second video was shot, Foval \u201cworked for People for the American Way, an organization funded in large part by George Soros.\u201d</p>, <p>In the video, Foval is heard saying, \u201cWe manipulated the vote with money and action, not with laws.\u201d</p>, <p>He then explains:</p>, <p>It\u2019s a pretty easy thing for Republicans to say, \u2018Well, they\u2019re bussing people in!\u2019 Well, you know what? We\u2019ve been bussing people in to deal with you fuckin\u2019 assholes for fifty years, and we\u2019re not going to stop now. We\u2019re just going to find a different way to do it. So, I mean I grew up with that idea. They used to bus people out to Iowa. If they needed people there we\u2019d bus people out to Iowa.</p>, <p>Foval also discusses the problem\xa0of being caught, stating, \u201cThe question is, whether when you get caught by a reporter, does that matter? Because does it turn into an investigation or not? In this case, this state, the answer is no, because they don\u2019t have any power to do anything.\u201d</p>, <p>Foval suggests that the voter fraud scheme could potentially be implemented \u201con a much bigger scale. You implement a massive change in state legislatures and in Congress. So you aim higher for your goals, and you implement it across every Republican-held state.\u201d</p>, <p>He then speculates on \u201cthe ripest environment to do it in\u201d:</p>, <p>Honestly the ripest environment to do it in? Two, within striking distance. Michigan, Indiana. Least restrictive donation caps and campaign finance laws and investigative arms, and any of that. Like they have weakened it so bad in those three states, you could fuck your mother in front of the governor and not go to jail. If you have enough money to do this.</p>, <p>Creamer, as Breitbart\u2019s Joel Pollak reported, is \u201ca veteran Chicago activist and convicted felon who is\xa0<a href="/web/20161018235930/http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2009/12/07/was-democrats-health-care-strategy-written-in-federal-prison/">thought to have planned</a>\xa0Democrats\u2019 political strategy during the push for Obamacare in 2009 and 2010. Creamer is also the co-founder of\xa0<a href="/web/20161018235930/http://www.democracypartners.com/">Democracy Partners</a>, a consulting group that, according to Project Veritas videos, apparently contracts directly with the Hillary Clinton campaign and the DNC, and that works with an array of super PACs and consultants to organize, film and publicize their provocations.\u201d</p>, <p>Foval is heard in the second video saying:</p>, <p>Bob Creamer is diabolical and I love him for it. I have learned so much from that man over the last twenty years, I can\u2019t even tell you. And he calls me to be his firefighter a lot of the time, because there are people who in our movement will not do what it takes to get shit done. And I\u2019m not that person. I\u2019m the one they send when everything has gone to shit. And so he spends a lot of time on the phone with my boss asking me to go places that I don\u2019t wish to go.</p>, <p>While the second video captures Foval and the Project Veritas undercover reporter\xa0brainstorming about the voter fraud scheme, O\u2019Keefe notes that \u201cCreamer hesitated to help our \u2018donor\u2019 pull off the voter fraud scheme that Foval crafted.\u201d</p>, <p>However, Foval did put the Project Veritas \u201cdonor\u201d in touch with another leftwing\xa0operative who appeared more receptive: Cesar Vargas.</p>, <p>As O\u2019Keefe explains: \u201cVargas is an interesting character. He is the co-founder of the Dream Action Coalition, a New York lawyer, and is a dreamer himself. Born in Mexico, Vargas is an undocumented alien. He has known Bob Creamer for years.\u201d</p>, <p>In the video, Vargas is heard saying about the voter fraud scheme:</p>, <p>Like I said, this is not gonna happen this election. So I think it\u2019s about, for us, let\u2019s see who the next president is. If it \u2013 if it\u2019s Donald Trump, it even makes more sense. The issue will be more credible and it\u2019ll give us more opportunity to jump in there. If it\u2019s Secretary Clinton, and the voter ID laws are losing and we have much more opportunity to vote, and we have immigration reform, it\u2019s not going to be as significant, right?</p>, <p>When the Project Veritas reporter\xa0points out that this would be \u201cvoter fraud,\u201d Vergas replies, \u201cIt\u2019s civil disobedience.\u201d</p>, <p>The video ends with a clip of Foval stating, \u201cWe have to do a better job of making our people do what they\u2019re supposed to do. Not asking them. Making them. Not expecting them and taking them for granted, but beating the shit out of them.\u201d</p>, <p>O\u2019Keefe notes that more videos in this undercover investigation \u201cwill continue through the election.\u201d</p>, <p><strong>Update:</strong></p>, <p>J. Christian Adams, the President and General Counsel of the Public Interest Legal Foundation, has <a href="/web/20161018235930/https://publicinterestlegal.org/files/PVA-FEC-Complaint.pdf">filed a legal complaint</a>\xa0with the Federal Election Commission against \u201cHillary for America, the Democratic National Committee, Democracy Partners, Americans United for Change, and other known and unknown individuals and groups\u201d based on O\u2019Keefe\u2019s second video investigation.</p>, <p>Adams issued the following statement to Breitbart News:</p>, <p>American voter rolls are corrupted with unacceptable numbers of aliens who are illegally registered to vote. Groups should not be coordinating with campaigns and political parties to exploit vulnerabilities in our election system. We hope this matter is fully investigated and that if aliens are voting, they are prosecuted by the Justice Department. That would mark a change in DOJ policies of the last 7 years.</p>, <p>As the complaint\xa0notes, the Public Interest Legal Foundation (PILF) is \u201cis a non-profit educational and legal foundation dedicated to protect the right to vote, preserve the Constitutional framework of American elections, and educate the public on the issue of election integrity.\u201d</p>, <p>Read their complaint\xa0<a href="/web/20161018235930/https://publicinterestlegal.org/files/PVA-FEC-Complaint.pdf">here</a>.</p>]
