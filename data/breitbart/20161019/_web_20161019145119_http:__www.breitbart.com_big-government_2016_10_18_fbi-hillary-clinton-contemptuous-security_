[<p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>The individual\u2019s remarks came to light Monday in a <a href="/web/20161019135801/https://vault.fbi.gov/hillary-r.-clinton/hillary-r.-clinton-part-04-of-04/view">release of FBI documents</a> relating to the investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of an unsecured, homebrew email server to conduct all of her business as Secretary of State \u2014 in contradiction of federal records keeping laws. The interviewee, whose name is redacted on the document, \u201cserved as an Assistant Shift Leader on former Secretary of State CONDOLEEZZA RICE\u2019s and HILLARY CLINTON\u2019s protective details.\u201d</p>, <p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>This woman said Clinton treated the agents protecting her and her staff\u2019s lives with \u201ccontempt.\u201d The document states: \u201c[Redacted] explained that CLINTON\u2019s treatment of DS agents on her protective detail was so contemptuous that many of them sought reassignment or employment elsewhere.</p>, <p>\u201cPrior to CLINTON\u2019s tenure, being an agent on the Secretary of State\u2019s protective detail was seen as an honor and privilege reserved for senior agents. However, by the end of CLINTON\u2019s tenure, it was staffed largely with new agents because it was difficult to find senior agents willing to work for her.</p>, <p>\u201c[Redacted] claims to have had at least one conversation with Secret Service agents who experienced the same poor treatment.\u201d</p>, <p>The individual giving this interview also claimed Clinton would put her staff in dangerous situations against the advice of her security \u2014 and agents suspected that she did so to generate\xa0\u201cfavorable press\u201d and photo ops that she could use for a presidential campaign.</p>, <p>On a trip to Jakarta, Indonesia, in early 2009, CLINTON requested to visit an area of Jakarta that presented security and safety challenges. This visit was reportedly for a photo opportunity regarding CLINTON\u2019s \u201cclean cooking stoves\u201d initiative. The DS advance team recommended against traveling to this area because the route could not be secured and was lined with dangerous circumstances and individuals. As such, the DS advance team recommended in writing that this excursion be stricken from the schedule but were told by DS management that it was going to happen because \u201cshe wanted it.\u201d DS agents felt this excursion into potentially hostile areas placed CLINTON, her staff, the media, and her security detail in unnecessary danger in order to conduct a photo opportunity for \u201cher election campaign.\u201d <strong>DS agents had the perception that CLINTON was using her position as Secretary of State to campaign for President of the United States.</strong> DS agents felt CLINTON traveled with hand-picked media who would present her in favorable light in order to garner political support. It was also believed that CLINTON disregarded security and diplomatic protocols, occasionally without regard for the safety of her staff and protection detail, in order to gain favorable press. [emphasis added]</p>, <p>The interviewee recalled an anecdote where Clinton exposed her limousine driver to danger by badgering him to open a window in \u201ca dangerous area of the West Bank\u201d:</p>, <p>CLINTON traveled in an armored vehicle whose passenger windows do not open. This is a design feature for the protection of the occupants. However, the driver\u2019s window does open slightly. On one occasion while traveling to Palestine CLINTON ordered the limousine driver, believed to be [Redacted] to open the window while in \u201coccupied territory\u201d, referring to a dangerous area of the West Bank. [Redacted] initially declined to respond to CLINTON\u2019s request; however, repeated demands by CLINTON forced him to open his window despite the danger to himself and the occupants.</p>, <p>This testimony echoes the accounts of several Secret Service agents who have similarly described Clinton\u2019s behavior as abusive.</p>, <p>Author Ronald Kessler, who has written several books based on interviews with USSS agents, has one interviewee who gives the <a href="/web/20161019135801/http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/08/20/report-hillary-clinton-huma-abedin-abuse-secret-service-agents/">exact same assessment</a> as\xa0the former State employee:</p>, <p>There\u2019s not an agent in the service who wants to be in Hillary\u2019s detail. If agents get the nod to go to her detail, that\u2019s considered a form of punishment among the agents. She\u2019s hard to work around, she\u2019s known to snap at agents and yell at agents and dress them down to their faces, and they just have to be humble and say, \u201cYes ma\u2019am,\u201d and walk away. Agents don\u2019t deserve that. They\u2019re there to do a job, they\u2019re there to protect her, they\u2019ll lay their life down for hers, and there\u2019s absolutely no respect for that. And that\u2019s why agents do not want to go to her detail.</p>, <p>Former Secret Service agent Gary Byrne released a book, <a href="/web/20161019135801/http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/06/20/exclusive-secret-service-agent-book-raging-hillary-clinton-threw-bible-at-agents-colleague/"><em>Crisis of Character</em></a>, earlier this year alleging that she would have regular \u201ceruptions\u201d over small slights or even polite greetings. \u201cShe\u2019d explode in my face without reservation or decorum,\u201d Byrne said of his first-hand experiences. One colleague reported that Clinton responded to him saying, \u201cGood morning, First Lady,\u201d with a \u201cGo f*** yourself.\u201d Another told Byrne that she\xa0threw a Bible and hit him in the back of the head in\xa0an episode of rage.</p>]
