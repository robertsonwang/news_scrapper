Some adherents of Shiite Islam participate in self-flagellation to mourn the Prophet Mohammed\u2019s grandson Imam Hussein who was killed at the Battle of Karbala almost 1,400 years ago by forces loyal to Yazid bin Muawiyyah, Islam\u2019s sixth caliph</p>, <p>Although Imam Hussein is adored by both Sunnis and Shiites alike, Islam separated into Sunnis and Shiites after his death.</p>, <p><iframe frameborder="0" height="356" src="/web/20161020200734if_/http://www.memritv.org/embedded_player/index.php?clip_id=5713" width="404"></iframe></p>, <p>In a video posted on Kurdish news outlet Rudaw, he said:</p>, <p>In this day and age when our youth in the prime of life\u2026 Set out for the battlefronts to fight the filthiest of the creations of Allah\u2026 When they fight, they are killing the the enemies of Hussein. The enemies of Hussein are the enemies of the Messenger of Allah. They are the enemies of Allah\u2026</p>, <p>The liberation of Mosul will be the revenge against the killers of Hussein, because these [ISIS] are their grandsons. Allah willing, the liberation of Mosul will be vengeance and retribution against the killers of Hussein.\u201d</p>, <p>There has been debate lately as to whether the PMF, also known as the Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) or al-Hashd al-Shabi, should participate in the offensive to recapture Mosul given that some of the Shiite militias were accused of torturing \u201c<a href="/web/20161020200734/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/06/07/civilians-tortured-iran-backed-shiite-militia-fallujah/">hundreds</a>\u201d of Sunni fighters after they helped the Iraqi troops recapture Fallujah, in Anbar province from ISIS.</p>, <p>Some Shiite militias were also accused of <a href="/web/20161020200734/https://www.hrw.org/report/2015/09/20/ruinous-aftermath/militias-abuses-following-iraqs-recapture-tikrit">looting and extrajudicial killings</a> after the U.S.-backed Iraqi forces seized back Tikrit in Salah al-Din province from ISIS.</p>, <p>Nevertheless, the commander, in the video posted on Rudaw said:</p>, <p>Dear brothers, the Popular Mobilization Units must participate in the liberation of Mosul.
