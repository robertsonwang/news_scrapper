[<p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>Monday, on the <em>Tolbert and Lund Show</em> on San Francisco\u2019s sports talk station KNBR, former 49er Brent Jones told Niners fans exactly what he thought of Kaepernick\u2019s performance on Sunday, and <a href="/web/20170103042136/http://www.knbr.com/2016/10/17/brent-jones-i-took-a-knee-to-protest-some-of-kaps-throws/">what it inspired him to do</a>:</p>, <p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>\u201cI got to tell you, there was five or six throws yesterday where I took a knee in protest,\u201d Jones jested. \u201cThose are horrific throws for the NFL, or college.\u201d</p>, <p>Kaepernick completed 13 of his 29 passes for 187 yards, one touchdown and no interceptions. The quarterback was clinging onto a 17-13 lead late in the third quarter despite no running game or defense to help him.</p>, <p>\u201cI actually heard yesterday people try and say Kap was decent, and I\u2019m like compared to what?\u201d Jones said. \u201cAre you kidding? Have our expectations sunk so drastically low that you could say that?</p>, <p>\u201cYou have to be able to make throws. You don\u2019t get 20 chances a game to throw a touchdown pass. And Kap missed a couple yesterday. Torrey Smith on a post route, he zinged it five yards over his head. Poor Torrey Smith. That poor guy must be thinking, are you kidding me? How many times have I been open for touchdowns down the field and none of my quarterbacks can even get the ball within range.\u201d</p>, <p><iframe frameborder="0" height="300" scrolling="no" src="/web/20170103042136if_/http://embeds.audioboom.com/posts/5175270-10-17-brent-jones-says-the-49ers-cupboard-of-talent-is-pretty-bare/embed/v4?eid=AQAAAHiPBljm904A" style="display: block; max-width: 700px; background-color: transparent;" title="audioBoom player" width="100%"></iframe></p>, <p>Kaepernick has maintained that we will continue to see him taking a knee during the national anthem for the foreseeable future. Though, after last Sunday\u2019s performance, it\u2019s hard to see Kaepernick taking a knee in a \u201cvictory\u201d formation anytime soon.</p>, <p>@themightygwinn</p>]
