[<p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>\u201cFrankly, if we got along with Russia, and knocked out ISIS, that would be a good thing, not a bad thing,\u201d Trump said Monday on Michael Savage\u2019s radio show, adding:</p>, <p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>Now, if there\u2019s anything with Russia, they say Russia loves Donald Trump. Putin loves Donald Trump. And they insult him constantly. I mean, no wonder he can\u2019t stand Obama and Hillary Clinton. But, it is a very serious problem. I think it is the worst, it\u2019s the worst situation we\u2019ve had with Russia since the end of the Cold War by far.</p>, <p>The problem is, Putin has no respect for Obama at all. Doesn\u2019t like him and doesn\u2019t respect him. And Obama doesn\u2019t like Putin. They have a great dislike for each other\u2026And I think that, you have potentially a very catastrophic situation here.</p>, <p>\u201cIf I win on November 8th\u2026I could see myself meeting with Putin and meeting with Russia prior to the start of the administration,\u201d Trump said.</p>, <p>Trump doubled down on his claims that the election is being rigged. He said to Michael Savage:</p>, <p>This despite the press, which is horrible, phony. They print lies. They want to put lies on all the time. Michael, there\u2019s a backlash like we\u2019ve never seen before. I just heard from Mike Pence. He said there\u2019s a backlash like you\u2019ve never seen. People know it\u2019s all phony stuff. And that\u2019s why I say that the election\u2019s rigged. It\u2019s rigged by the media! They\u2019re willing to put front-page stories on that are lies.</p>, <p>\u201cThey\u2019re also, if you look at the polls and the polling places in various cities, they\u2019re also rigged in the cities. Let\u2019s not kid ourselves, in different places.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cThey\u2019re incompetent people. Obama is incompetent as a president and Hillary is beyond that,\u201d Trump said.</p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" src="/web/20161020173918if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/A2-mS7hH5vM" width="560"></iframe></p>]
