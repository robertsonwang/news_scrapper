[<p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>Clinton\u2019s campaign manager Robby Mook said Clinton\xa0\u201cshouldn\u2019t have Israel at public events,\u201d while Jake Sullivan, Clinton\u2019s top foreign policy adviser, disagreed, advising Clinton that her central message should include \u201ca sentence on standing up for our allies and our values, including Israel and other fellow democracies, and confronting terrorists and dictators with strength and cunning.\u201d</p>, <p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>In the May 2017 discussion, Mandy Grunwald, Clinton\u2019s senior communications adviser, responded to Sullivan: \u201cI though(t) this was largely for her TP (talking points) with public events not fundraisers. Do we need Israel etc for that?\u201d</p>, <p>Sullivan replied: \u201cWe def(initely) need the etc. I think good to have Israel too.\u201d</p>, <p>Clinton\u2019s chief strategist Joel Beneson then asked if there was any sense in mentioning Israel: \u201cWhy would we call out Israel in public events now? The only voters elevating FP (foreign policy) at all are Republican primary voters. To me we deal with this in stride when and if we are asked about FP.\u201d</p>, <p>Sullivan responded by reminding the team that \u201cShe was Secretary of State.\u201d</p>, <p>Campaign manager Mook disagreed: \u201cI\u2019m w(ith) Joel. We shouldn\u2019t have Israel at public events. Especially dem (Democratic) activists.\u201d</p>, <p>Sullivan acquiesced, writing: \u201cI won\u2019t fall on sword over Israel but we need more than climate in that paragraph.\u201d</p>, <p>Clinton\u2019s director of speechwriting Dan Schwerin suggested the following:</p>, <p>What about this as a base, and then she can drop in Israel when she\u2019s with donors: Fourth and finally, we have to protect our country from the global threats that we see, from terrorists to dictators to diseases \u2013 and the ones that are still over the horizon. We have to assert confident American leadership to shape global events rather than be shaped by them. That includes taking on global warming and those who continue to deny that it exists. And it means always standing up for our allies and our values, especially our fellow democracies.</p>, <p>In another email exchange, Clinton\u2019s team discussed a draft of her speech at the Jewish Federation of Des Moines in January. The team considered whether to infer that Bernie Sanders\u2019 position on Iran may put Israel in danger.</p>, <p>Speechwriter Schwerin asked the campaign team to \u201clet me know if we should add a Bernie hit on Iran in here. Right now it\u2019s pretty straight.\u201d</p>, <p>Sarah Bard, Clinton\u2019s Jewish Outreach director said she thought it was best to \u201cnot name him specifically. Reference ideology, without using the exact language Bernie used, and making it very clear what she\u2019s referencing. Something like, \u2018those who suggest that we looks past human rights violations, blatant disregard of international law and \u2026 by the leading state sponsor of terrorism, Iran, are dangerously naive or who largely uninformed about how the world works.'\u201d</p>, <p>Foreign policy adviser Sullivan warned that it was best not to use the words \u201cnaive or uninformed\u201d and ultimately suggested that \u201cI would lay off.\u201d</p>, <p>In another instance in which Clinton was advised not to sound \u201cna\xefve,\u201d was in her November 2015 column on the two-state solution in the <a href="/web/20161019150821/http://forward.com/opinion/national/324013/how-i-would-rebuild-ties-to-israel-and-benjamin-neta/?attribution=author-article-listing-1-headline">Forward</a>.</p>, <p>Stuart Eizenstat, a former US diplomat and close associate of the Clintons, <a href="/web/20161019150821/http://www.timesofisrael.com/campaign-manager-to-clinton-avoid-israel-talk-to-keep-base-happy/">wrote</a>:</p>, <p>\u201cAttached are my edits to an excellent draft. We must be careful on not seeming na\xefve on the two-state solution. She must support it, but suggest initial confidence building steps now, which is all that can be expected, to set a stage for broader negotiations.\u201d</p>]
