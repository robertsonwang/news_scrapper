The Wikileaks email trove produced a <a href="/web/20161019205544/https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/2098">legal memorandum</a> addressed to Hillary For America (HFA), explaining what types of communication are permitted and prohibited under federal campaign finance laws. It notes:</p>, <p>Communications between HFA and Priorities should generally be limited to each entity\u2019s finance directors \u2013 Dennis Cheng (HFA) and Justin Brennan (Priorities). Communications between Dennis and Justin should be limited to fundraising; they should not discuss polling, research, or other nonpublic strategic information or plans pertaining to either organization\u2019s communications or spending. Moreover, we understand that Justin is not privy to Priorities\u2019 nonpublic strategic information or plans, which adds an additional layer of protection.</p>, <p>However, the communications described by Democracy Partners consultant Scott Foval arguably go far beyond that. According to Foval, a network of consultants maintains the \u201cPony Express,\u201d which he describes as \u201ca text conversation that never ends.\u201d The information exchanged apparently includes strategy regarding \u201cbird-dogging,\u201d a practice where trained activists infiltrate Republican rallies and try to provoke violence.</p>, <p>The dialogue between Foval and an undercover Project Veritas journalist is as follows:</p>, <p>FOVAL: We have a clip deliverable that we have to deliver every day for our groups of clients who are involved in this project: AUFC; A4C, which is Alliance for Change; Alliance for Retired Americans, which is part of AFL-CIO \u2014 they\u2019re one of our partners on the AUFC stuff \u2026 Depends on the issue. And then there\u2019s the DNC, and the campaigns, and Priorities [USA]. Priorities is a big part of this, too. The campaigns and DNC cannot coordinate with Priorities, but I guaran-damn-tee you that the people who run the Super PACs all talk to each other, and we and a few other people are the hubs of that communication.</p>, <p>PV: Like, so, you\u2019re kind of like \u2014</p>, <p>FOVAL: Consultants.</p>, <p>PV:\xa0 \u2014 intermediaries between the Super PACs and the DNC. But the DNC, they can\u2019t talk to each other. But you guys are kind of like \u2014</p>, <p>FOVAL: We\u2019re consultants, so we\u2019re not the official entity. And so those conversations can be had between consultants who are working for different parts. That\u2019s why there\u2019s Bob, who\u2019s the primary there, and I\u2019m a sub to him. And I\u2019m also a primary to AUFC separately, that\u2019s why.</p>, <p>PV: So there\u2019s like a Morse code between the DNC and that Super PACs.And you guys \u2014</p>, <p>FOVAL: It\u2019s less of a Morse code than it is a text conversation that never ends. It\u2019s like that. It\u2019s kind of like an ongoing \u201cPony Express.\u201d It\u2019s not as official as it could be, but that\u2019s because the law doesn\u2019t allow it to be.</p>, <p>Former Federal Election Commission member Hans van Spakovsky told Breitbart News via e-mail that the \u201cPony Express\u201d may be illegal, and possibly even criminal:</p>, <p>This undercover video describes a text-messaging chain of communications between the Clinton presidential campaign and Democracy Partners and other super PACs that they call the Pony Express. If they are coordinating their activities as described then it is a blatant violation of federal campaign finance law. And the Pony Express communication system shows an intentional and knowing violation of the law, which constitutes a criminal violation not just a civil violation. The arrogance displayed in the videos about deliberately and intentionally breaking the law is truly shocking.</p>, <p><em>Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.
