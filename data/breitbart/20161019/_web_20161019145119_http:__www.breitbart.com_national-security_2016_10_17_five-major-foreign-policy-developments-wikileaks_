However, emails produced by WikiLeaks suggest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu feels Clinton is \u201cmore instinctively sympathetic to Israel than the White House,\u201d and the worst moment in his relationship with her came when she was \u201cheavily scripted and reading from points prepared by the White House.\u201d That\u2019s funny, because President Obama and his defenders have been loudly insisting they were the best friends Israel ever had. </span></p>, <p><b>4.\xa0<a href="/web/20161019205010/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/10/14/clinton-emails-cuba/">Clinton hearts Cuba</a></b><b>: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is clear that Clinton will be useful to special interests that want to make money in Cuba, and enrich the dictatorship in return. Clinton\u2019s team was also very happy to use Cuba as a political prop, in part because, as one special interest contact put it, \u201cit would drive Rubio, Cruz, and others nuts.\u201d The brutality and repression of the Castro regime mean absolutely </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">nothing </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to these people, and yet they portray themselves as morally superior proponents of human rights. To read anything from the WikiLeaks dump referencing Cuba, you\u2019d think the horrors of totalitarian communist repression were carried out by distant ancestors of the Castros, and it\u2019s faintly amusing that anyone would still be hung up on it.</span></p>, <p><b>3.\xa0<a href="/web/20161019205010/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/10/13/wikileaks-dem-sen-reids-adviser-calls-promoting-project-progressive-islam/">The project for \u201cprogressive Islam\u201d</a></b><b>: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most interesting thing about this leaked email is that Clinton\u2019s inner circle and their connections in the Islamic world think \u201cprogressive Islam\u201d is necessary, because on the record, Clinton claims Islam </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> already pretty darn progressive. Everything bad associated with Islam is supposedly the work of people who aren\u2019t true Muslims. The interesting conclusion to be reached from following these discussions is that global Islam is much more complicated, and messy, than the official pronouncements of Democrats would indicate. As long as Democrats are single-mindedly determined to pander to Muslim-Americans, convinced the \u201canti-Muslim backlash\u201d is a graver threat than terrorism, and above all else clubbing political opponents with accusations of anti-Muslim bigotry, they\u2019ll remain dangerous on both national security, and the more subtle clash of civilizations.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>2</strong><b>.\xa0<a href="/web/20161019205010/http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/13/wikileaks-bombshell-foreign-govt-donors-money/">\u201cForeign govt donors: all the money is in\u201d</a></b><b>: </b>Does anyone really doubt all that foreign money pouring into the Clinton Foundation is going to have a profound impact on American foreign policy, if Hillary Clinton gets into the White House? We\u2019ll be lucky if the new Clinton Administration steering lucrative overseas contracts to Foundation donors is the worst of it.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>1.\xa0<a href="/web/20161019205010/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/10/17/wikileaks-hillary-clinton-told-goldman-sachs-supports-bombing-iran/">Clinton said Iran could only be contained by bombing their nuclear facilities</a></b><b>:</b> Hillary Clinton\u2019s conversation with Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein in 2013 included her suggestion that Iran should be made to feel more \u201cpain\u201d by \u201cnot in any way occupying or invading them but by bombing their facilities.\u201d Painless aerial bombardment is the Democrats\u2019 favorite foreign policy tool, along with supplying weapons to local fighters who will serve as America\u2019s deniable, easily abandoned boots on the ground. Neither of those strategies works very well, as Blankfein observed to his credit\u2026 and Clinton agreed with his assertion that bombing-only campaigns have never \u201cworked in the history of war.\u201d It\u2019s as muddled as everything else Hillary Clinton says on foreign policy, but it\u2019s arguably a more aggressive stance than Obama doctrine.</span></p>, <p><a href="/web/20161019205010/http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/11/wikileaks-reveals-podestas-obsession-with-aliens-space-aliens/"><b>BONUS \u2013 UFO mania</b></a><b>: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It\u2019s the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ultimate </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">foreign policy issue!</span></p>]
