Over one million civilians may flee, the UN warns. UN agencies have built five camps in anticipation of the Mosul initiative.\xa0While the coalition has yet to approach the city of Mosul proper, reports of the Islamic State using civilians as human shields are <a href="/web/20161020200613/http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-idUSKCN12I17X">surfacing already</a>. European leaders are also warning that they may face not only an influx of new refugees\xa0but a <a href="/web/20161020200613/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-37689210">tide of fleeing Islamic State jihadists</a> looking to return home and avoid death on the battlefield.</p>, <p>As the operation continues, tensions between Shiite militias, the Shiite Iraqi government, Turkish forces, Kurdish soldiers, and a Kurdish Marxist terrorist group are growing. While the fight against the Islamic State is going slowly but smoothly, the political future of Mosul remains extremely uncertain in the event that the Islamic State falls.</p>, <p>At least one civilian representative, Nineveh plains tribe spokesman\xa0Azaz Khlaf Hajij, told Rudaw they are only agreeing to aid because of the peshmerga\u2019s presence.\xa0\u201cWe trust the Peshmerga forces one hundred per cent to successfully liberate Mosul, but as for the Iraqi forces, we have our own fears,\u201d he told the outlet. The Islamic State was able to conquer Mosul largely because the Iraqi soldiers stationed in the city <a href="/web/20161020200613/https://news.vice.com/article/iraqi-soldiers-fleeing-isis-claim-they-were-abandoned-by-senior-officers">fled</a>.</p>, <p>The leaders of these respective forces are trying to keep a united front.

Erdogan, who has dismissed Abadi as \u201c<a href="/web/20161020200613/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/10/11/turkey-wants-mosul-battle/">not on my level</a>,\u201d insists that Turkish troops will help liberate Mosul, to protect Sunni populations that he believes will be ethnically cleansed by invading Shiite militias.</p>, <p>\u201cWhat you call \u2018Baghdad\u2019 is an administrator of an army composed of Shiites,\u201d Erdogan <a href="/web/20161020200613/http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-preparing-to-be-on-the-field-in-mosul-operation-erdogan.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=105089&amp;NewsCatID=352">said Tuesday</a>. \u201cWill we talk to them?
