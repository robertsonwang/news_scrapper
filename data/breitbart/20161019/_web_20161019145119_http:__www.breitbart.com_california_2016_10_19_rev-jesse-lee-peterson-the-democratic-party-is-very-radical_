Jesse Lee Peterson:</strong>\xa0I wasn\u2019t surprised by that at all. The Democratic Party, especially the representatives of some of these unions, are very radical. They would do whatever it takes to win an election and they are sending these people out to cause problems at Donald Trump rallies. And then the media \u2026 certain parts of the media, they blame Donald Trump for, when Donald Trump supporters are not causing all of this violence and fights that break out at the rallies. The Democrats. I even had one person tell me that they were paid by the Democrats to go out and start fights at Donald Trump rallies. And I\u2019m not surprised by that at all. And Democrats. You know what\u2019s beautiful about this? This is the first time in the history of America that the Democrats have had to deal with a Republican who stood up and is standing up against them.</p>, <p class="p1">The Republicans have been able to falsely accuse. I mean, the Democrats have been able to falsely accuse Republicans of hating women, hating the homosexuals, hating the blacks. They\u2019ve accused them of being rapists. And the Republicans have not stood up and fought back and exposed the Democrats. Donald Trump is doing that and the Democrats don\u2019t know how to handle that.</p>, <p class="p1">They\u2019ve never been able \u2014 They\u2019ve never had to deal with a real fight such as they are having to deal with now.\xa0Donald Trump is the man for the country. He will Make America Great Again. And he will be our next president.</p>, <p class="p1"><strong>BB:</strong> Are you concerned with voter fraud, similar to what happened during President Barack Obama\u2019s election?</p>, <p class="p1"><strong>JLP:</strong>\xa0Yes. I\u2019m concerned with voter fraud. The Democrats will do whatever they can to win this election. They\u2019ll steal it. They\u2019ll register dead people. They\u2019ll register animals. They\u2019ll register anyone in order to steal this rally. I mean this presidential whatever [election].</p>, <p class="p1"><strong>BB:</strong> And if Hillary Clinton does win come November 8, do you think that the Senate will be secured by Republicans or Democrats will win that back?</p>, <p class="p1"><strong>JLP:</strong> You know, that\u2019s a good question. I think Republicans will still rule, but you can\u2019t depend on the RINO Republicans anymore. They allowed Barack Obama to turn America into a socialist society. They were afraid of him for fear of being called racist. And then, some of them agree with Barack Obama \u2014 like Paul Ryan and others.</p>, <p class="p1">So, I don\u2019t expect anything from the RINO Republicans at all, based on the way they dealt with Barack Obama. They allowed him to destroy and divide the races like no one else before in the history of America.</p>, <p class="p1"><strong>BB:</strong> Thank you.</p>, <p class="p1"><strong>JLP:</strong> They cannot be relied on.</p>, <p class="p1"><strong>BB:</strong> Thank you.</p>, <p class="p1"><i>Follow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter and Periscope\xa0</i><a href="/web/20161020200700/https://twitter.com/AdelleNaz"><span class="s1"><i>@AdelleNaz</i></span></a></p>]
