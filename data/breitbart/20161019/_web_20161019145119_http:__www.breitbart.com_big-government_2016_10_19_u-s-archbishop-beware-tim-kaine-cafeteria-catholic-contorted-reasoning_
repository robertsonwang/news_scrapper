[<p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>In a stinging <a href="/web/20161020200716/http://theleaven.org/our-choices-end-where-anothers-more-fundamental-right-begins/">column</a> in his diocesan newspaper, <em>The Leaven</em>, Kansas City Archbishop Joseph Naumann said that it was \u201cpainful\u201d to listen to Senator Kaine repeat \u201cthe same tired and contorted reasoning to profess his personal opposition to abortion while justifying his commitment to keep it legal\u201d in the last vice-presidential debate.</p>, <p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>While boasting of his Catholic credentials, Kaine fell back on \u201call the usual made-for-modern-media sound bites,\u201d the Archbishop noted, such as it is \u201cnot proper to impose his religious beliefs upon all Americans\u201d and he \u201ctrusts women to make good reproductive choices.\u201d</p>, <p>The Archbishop appealed to voters to \u201cbe wary of candidates who assume to take upon themselves the role of defining what Catholics believe or should believe.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d he continued, \u201cthe vice-presidential debate revealed that the Catholic running for the second highest office in our land is an orthodox member of his party, fulling embracing his party\u2019s platform, but a cafeteria Catholic, picking and choosing the teachings of the Catholic Church that are politically convenient.\u201d</p>, <p>Underscoring Kaine\u2019s \u201ccontorted reasoning,\u201d Naumann observed that the Senator \u201cappears to have no qualms\u201d imposing his religious beliefs when it comes to opposing racism or encouraging a preferential option for the poor, or when our public policies mirror \u201cthe Ten Commandments with regard to stealing, perjury, or forms of murder, other than abortion.\u201d</p>, <p>In the Declaration of Independence itself, Naumann notes, the founders stated that \u201cthe right to life is given to us by our Creator, not by the Supreme Court.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cWhy is Senator Kaine personally opposed to abortion, if he does not believe that it is the taking of an innocent human life?\u201d Naumann asks. And if abortion is killing an innocent human being, why does Kaine publicly support it?</p>, <p>\u201cThis is where the reproductive choice euphemism breaks apart,\u201d the Archbishop said. \u201cDoes anyone really have the choice to end another human being\u2019s life?\u201d</p>, <p>Responding to Senator Kaine\u2019s stated fear that if abortion were made illegal again, our prisons would be teeming with post-abortive women, Naumann called up the historical record.</p>, <p>\u201cBefore the late 1960s when abortion was illegal in every state, except for the life-of-the-mother cases, it is difficult to find a single instance of a woman imprisoned for abortion,\u201d he said. \u201cThe laws were enforced against the abortionists. Our own legal experience shows clearly that it is possible to develop public policies aimed at protecting children, not punishing women.\u201d</p>, <p>Kaine goes beyond mere acquiescence and \u201cappears eager to champion not only maintaining the status quo, but actually expanding abortion rights,\u201d the Archbishop noted.</p>, <p>Naumann also berated Kaine for supporting efforts \u201cto coerce the Little Sisters of the Poor and other faith-based ministries to violate their conscience,\u201d to put small business owners \u201cout of business with crippling fines if they decline to participate in same-sex marriage ceremonies\u201d and \u201cto force every American taxpayer to help fund abortion.\u201d</p>, <p>At the conclusion of his column, Archbishop Naumann encouraged Catholic voters \u201cto think not only of the candidate, but who they will appoint to key Cabinet and other powerful government positions if he or she becomes president.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cWe are choosing not just a president, but an entire administration,\u201d he said.</p>, <p><em>Follow Thomas D.
