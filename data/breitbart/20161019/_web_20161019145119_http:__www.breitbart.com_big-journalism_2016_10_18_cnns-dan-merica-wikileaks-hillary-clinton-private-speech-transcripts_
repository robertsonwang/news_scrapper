[<p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>In a Tuesday article co-bylined with Tal Kopan bearing the vanilla headline \u201c<a href="/web/20161019115655/http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/18/politics/hillary-clinton-campaign-email-hack-what-learned/">What we\u2019ve learned from the hacked emails of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign (so far)</a>,\u201d Merica\u2019s main takeaway from the leaked emails and campaign documents is how hard-working and \u201cmethodical\u201d\xa0Clinton appears. Nothing about scandals. Nothing about the <a href="/web/20161019115655/http://www.breitbart.com/wikileaks/2016/10/14/clinton-foundation-ranked-410-lack-oversight/">troubling internal audit</a> of the <a href="/web/20161019115655/http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/14/clinton-foundation-internal-review-we-may-have-misled-irs/">Clinton Foundation</a>. Just a boring look at an impressively \u201cdeliberate\u201d campaign. <a href="/web/20161019115655/http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=BenSmithing">There is a word for this type of news story</a>.</p>, <p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>Merica is a CNN Politics producer and has covered Clinton on the campaign trail since the Democratic primary. His name is seen several times in the Podesta emails, suggesting a friendly, if not collaborative, relationship with Clinton and her staff.</p>, <p>In September of 2015, Nick Merrill, Clinton\u2019s traveling press secretary, was supposed to call Merica <a href="/web/20161019115655/https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/17096">call Merica ahead of</a>\xa0<a href="/web/20161019115655/http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/04/politics/hillary-clinton-2008-bernie-sanders-barack-obama/">his writeup</a> of an interview remark from Clinton, according to the campaign\u2019s Director of Communications Jennifer Palmieri. \u201cNick is calling dan Mercia [sic] who tweeted aboit it,\u201d she\xa0wrote.</p>, <p>Merrill\xa0described <a href="/web/20161019115655/https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/2391">a chummy exchange</a> between Merica and Clinton in February 2016: \u201cDan Merica asked her if she was jealous that she didn\u2019t get [Chris] Christie\u2019s endorsement, to which she responded with a prolonged smile (you could see the gears turning), and then said \u2018Dan, I really like you. I really really like you.\u2019 They are basically courting each other at this point.\u201d</p>, <p>Merica RSVPed \u201cyes\u201d to an off-the-record dinner at <a href="/web/20161019115655/http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2016/10/17/wikileaks-journalists-clinton-staff-homes-before-hillarys-campaign-launch/">Podesta\u2019s New York home</a> which took place three days before Clinton\u2019s campaign launch.</p>, <p>In Tuesday\u2019s explainer, Merica and Kopan declare that\xa0\u201csecret transcripts of Clinton\u2019s paid speeches behind closed doors on Wall Street have failed to turn up any positions widely different than what she says in public.\u201d</p>, <p>A cursory\xa0look at\xa0Wikileaks news coverage\xa0shows this idea is\xa0false. Here are just a few issues Merica and Kopan overlook:</p>, <p><strong>ON TRADE:</strong> The article makes no mention of international trade deals such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)\xa0and the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), a bill to \u201cfast track\u201d executive authority to negotiate those kinds of deals. Breitbart News\u2019 Matthew Boyle and Charlie Spiering reported on the <a href="/web/20161019115655/http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/13/wikileaks-boss-wont-comfortable-clinton-campaign-flipped-flopped-tpp/">Clinton campaign\u2019s reluctant move to imitate</a> Bernie Sanders\u2019 populist opposition to TPP, though Clinton was <a href="/web/20161019115655/http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/09/26/fact-check-clinton-lies-support-tpp/">on record saying</a>\xa0the prospective deal \u201cset the gold standard in trade agreements.\u201d</p>, <p>[H]er campaign manager Robby Mook [admits] that Hillary Clinton would not be \u201ccomfortable\u201d coming out against TPP during the campaign, even though she had to do it for votes.</p>, <p>\u2026</p>, <p>A previous <a href="/web/20161019115655/https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/6616" target="_blank">email exchange in March 2015</a> detailed how Clinton\u2019s staff believed she intended to support both TPA and TPP. The email from her lead speechwriter [Dan Schwerin] makes it very clear: The draft letter he was circulating \u201cassumes that she\u2019s ultimately going to support both TPA and TPP.\u201d</p>, <p>In one of Clinton\u2019s <a href="/web/20161019115655/http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/07/leaked-hillary-clinton-speech-to-foreign-bank-my-dream-is-a-hemispheric-common-market-with-open-trade-and-open-borders/">private speeches</a>, she told Brazil\u2019s\xa0Banco Ita\xfa, \u201cMy dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders.\u201d This directly contradicts Clinton\u2019s official immigration policy page\u2019s promise to\xa0\u201cprotect our borders and national security.\u201d More disturbingly, that admission contradicts the implicit promise of her candidacy. Her long-term agenda would mean surrendering the\xa0sovereignty of the nation\xa0she hopes to govern.</p>, <p><strong>ON MONEY IN POLITICS:</strong> Clinton released a <a href="/web/20161019115655/https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2015/09/08/restore-integrity-to-elections/">policy memo in 2015</a> to reform and strongly enforce campaign finance laws:</p>, <p>Americans are understandably cynical about a political system that has been hijacked by billionaires and special interests who will spend whatever it takes to crowd out the voices of everyday Americans. And with the rise of unlimited, secret spending in our political process, it is virtually impossible for anyone to really know who or what is influencing our elected officials. On issues from climate change to equal pay and immigration reform, voters won\u2019t believe Washington will work for them unless we take on the power and stranglehold that wealthy interests have over our political system.</p>, <p>\u2026</p>, <p>Finally, for our campaign finance system to have meaning, Clinton believes we must\xa0<strong>vigorously enforce our campaign finance laws</strong>. [emphasis original]</p>, <p>On both counts, Wikileaks shows Clinton contradicting this position privately. On the first point, a\xa0\u201cflag\u201d from Clinton\u2019s speeches\xa0in\xa0a\xa0<a href="/web/20161019115655/http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/11/wikileaks-hillary-clinton-ask-business-lobby-washington-spending-immigrants/">campaign memo</a>\xa0reads: \u201cHillary Clinton Said Politicians Treat NYC Like An ATM And \u2018Political Givers\u2019 Need To Tell Politicians \u2018Here Are Things I Want You To Do For The Country.'\u201d On enforcing campaign finance laws, Hillary for America\u2019s top staffers <a href="/web/20161019115655/http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2016/10/18/wikileaks-coordination-clinton-campaign-super-pac/">openly and often discuss</a> how they can <a href="/web/20161019115655/http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/12/wikileaks-clinton-team-recommended-using-emilys-list-coordinate-ads-super-pac/">\u201ccoordinate\u201d</a> with friendly Super PACs wielding much larger war chests from donors.</p>, <p><strong>ON TRANSPARENCY:</strong> Clinton\u2019s inner circle contradicted Clinton\u2019s public explanations of an unsecured homebrew email server through which she conducted all her business as Secretary of State \u2014 in apparent violation of federal records keeping laws. As Clinton insisted publicy that she had turned over all work-related emails, Podesta himself <a href="/web/20161019115655/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/10/14/wikileaks-podesta-conspired-keep-emails-hillary-obama-benghazi-committee/">asks about withholding messages</a>\xa0to and from President Obama after Congress subpoenaed Clinton\u2019s emails.</p>, <p>And in a paid speech, Clinton admitted that as a politician, \u201cyou need both a public and a private position.\u201d This may seem like a point so obvious it does not even need to be spoken, but the obvious implication undercuts CNN\u2019s thesis \u2014 that Clinton\u2019s public and private beliefs are consistent.</p>, <p>A massive portion of the Podesta emails are spent organizing phone calls. What we see even in campaign memos and speeches, even emails, is still filtered by the knowledge that people could see this content who are not meant to see it. The public is still far from understanding\xa0the \u201creal\u201d Hillary Clinton. For instance, an FBI interview released on Monday suggests that the kind, soft-spoken grandmother persona which Clinton projects to the public is nothing like\xa0<a href="/web/20161019115655/http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/18/fbi-hillary-clinton-contemptuous-security/">the Clinton that her security agents see</a>.</p>, <p>Finally, Merica and Kopan remind their readers that revelations from the Podesta emails \u201chave been overshadowed by Clinton\u2019s opponent, Donald Trump, and the release of a hot-mic recording of Trump bragging about sexually aggressive behavior.\u201d</p>, <p>Perhaps <a href="/web/20161019115655/http://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/mike-ciandella/2016/10/13/7-1-trump-sex-scandals-vs-hillary-wikileaks-coverage">in their social circles</a>, yes, but the <a href="/web/20161019115655/https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/787301455002800128">public\u2019s interest</a> in Wikileaks greatly eclipses\xa0establishment journalists\u2019 interest in Trump. And they will likely ignore\xa0attempts, like this article\u2019s, to proclaim \u201cnothing to see here.\u201d</p>]
