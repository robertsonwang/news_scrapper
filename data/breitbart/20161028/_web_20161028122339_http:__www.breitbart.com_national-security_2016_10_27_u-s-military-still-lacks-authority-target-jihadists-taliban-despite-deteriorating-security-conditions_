[<p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>A top spokesman of the U.S.-NATO mission in the country confirmed that the rules of engagement forbid this to Breitbart News.</p>, <p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>In an exclusive statement, American Brig. Gen. Charles Cleveland, the U.S.-NATO mission\u2019s deputy chief of Staff for communication, explained that U.S. troops can only attack the Taliban in self-defense and when assisting Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) during combat.</p>, <p>Cleveland did not dispute the notion that American troops have to wait to be shot at first before they can attack the Taliban.</p>, <p>\u201cOur authorities do not authorize the targeting of Taliban forces by status. Because U.S. Forces have always had the self-defense authority, U.S. forces can always defend themselves and engage any element that poses an identified threat,\u201d the brigadier general told Breitbart News.</p>, <p>Last Friday, Cleveland declared that the ultimate goal of the war in Afghanistan is not the defeat of the Taliban, but rather a \u201c<a href="/web/20161028141918/http://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript-View/Article/982458/department-of-defense-press-briefing-by-brig-gen-cleveland-via-teleconference-f">negotiated solution</a> with the Taliban.\u201d</p>, <p>Although U.S. troops and military aircraft are allowed to attack jihadists from al-Qaeda and the local\xa0<a href="/web/20161028141918/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/01/21/u-s-military-given-green-light-to-target-islamic-state-in-afghanistan/">Islamic State branch</a>, the rules of engagement (ROE) when fighting the Taliban are different. The Taliban is the<a href="/web/20161028141918/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2015/10/13/afghanistan-turns-russia-taliban-builds-anti-isis-force/"> largest</a> and <a href="/web/20161028141918/http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2016/09/us-commander-in-afghanistan-downplays-taliban-control-of-10-percent-of-population.php">strongest</a> jihadist group in Afghanistan. It controls <a href="/web/20161028141918/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/07/30/watchdog-afghanistan-has-lost-control-of-more-than-one-third-of-nation/">more territory</a> than any of the many other terrorist groups operating in the region.</p>, <p>According to various assessments, security conditions are <a href="/web/20161028141918/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/10/18/wapo-white-house-believes-war-afghanistan-tipping-talibans-favor/">getting worse</a>, primarily due to the resilient Taliban.</p>, <p>Nevertheless, American forces are <a href="/web/20161028141918/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/05/24/u-s-military-wants-regain-authority-white-house-offensively-attack-afghan-taliban/">only able</a> to carry out operations against the Taliban when U.S. or coalition forces are under direct threat; when U.S. officials determine that the Taliban is providing direct support to al Qaeda; or when the Taliban pose a \u2018strategic threat\u2019 to ANDSF troops, which includes military and police units, explained the <a href="/web/20161028141918/http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-military-wants-more-leeway-to-strike-taliban-1464046997"><em>Wall Street Journal (WSJ)</em></a> earlier this year.</p>, <p>Cleveland\u2019s statement came in response to Breitbart News asking the top spokesman to elaborate on what he <a href="/web/20161028141918/http://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript-View/Article/982458/department-of-defense-press-briefing-by-brig-gen-cleveland-via-teleconference-f">told Pentagon reporters</a> last Friday.</p>, <p>Echoing a top U.S. general who is now retired, he indicated that the U.S. military is not able to target Taliban jihadists for \u201cjust being members of the Taliban.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cOur first authority is always force protection. So we\u2019re able to, you know, defend ourselves and use fire to do so,\u201d explained the brigadier general.</p>, <p>Some\xa0months before <a href="/web/20161028141918/https://www.army.mil/article/166093/After_nearly_four_decades_of_service__Gen__John_F__Campbell_retires">retiring</a> and leaving his post as top commander of U.S. and NATO forces,\xa0American Gen.

Campbell reportedly asked President Obama to <a href="/web/20161028141918/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/05/24/u-s-military-wants-regain-authority-white-house-offensively-attack-afghan-taliban/">once again </a>allow the American troops to offensively attack the Taliban, but his request fell on deaf ears.</p>, <p>U.S. troops \u2013 including Campbell\u2019s successor as top commander in Afghanistan, Gen. John Nicholson \u2013 have tried to persuade their commander-in-chief to resume the American military\u2019s authority to carry out offensive operations against the Afghan Taliban, but have seemingly failed.</p>, <p>In June, President Barack Obama did grant new authorities to the U.S. military that <a href="/web/20161028141918/http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/07/18/us-commander-progress-fighting-taliban-afghanistan/87257034/">deceptively appeared</a> to have resulted in American troops being able to once again go on the offensive when fighting the Taliban.</p>, <p>\u201cThe president of the United States provided new authorities to allow U.S. forces to help our Afghan partners achieve their overall strategic campaign plan,\u201d said Cleveland. \u201cThese new authorities allow for the use of combat enablers, including fire support, to help the Afghans accomplish their strategic goals.\u201d</p>, <p>After the Obama administration announced the new authorities, Cmdr.
