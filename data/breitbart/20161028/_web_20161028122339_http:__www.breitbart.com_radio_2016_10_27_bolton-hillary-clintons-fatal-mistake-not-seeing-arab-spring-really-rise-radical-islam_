It\u2019s not clear to me whether that\u2019s a permanent halt or temporary while they try and figure out what their next step is, but I was just amazed at the story when I read about it. So if it\u2019s come to an end, that\u2019s a good thing, but it was unbelievable that it got started to begin with,\u201d he added.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marlow asked Bolton for an update on Turkey, which has been </span><a href="/web/20161028151304/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/10/25/turkey-wants-ground-operation-iraq/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">threatening a ground invasion of Iraq</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cWell, this is a good indication of how the conflict, whether it\u2019s in Syria or Iraq, is not a two-sided war, and how complex it is, and how infantile, really, the Obama administration\u2019s strategy is,\u201d Bolton observed. \u201cThe Turks are determined that whatever else happens in Syria, the Kurds are not going to be able to get contiguous territory stretching from Syria into Iraq, and then up into southern and southeastern Turkey, to help them establish an independent Kurdish state that would essentially include all the territories where there\u2019s an ethnic Kurdish minority.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cDespite what the Turks have said before about their views of the Assad regime, their views of ISIS, they can still find time in the midst of those struggles to bomb the Kurds \u2013 who are, by the way, fighting ISIS,\u201d he noted. \u201cIt\u2019s something that may seem confusing in the United States, but in the bizarre context of the Middle East, actually from a Turkish point of view, it makes perfectly good sense.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bolton next addressed the Islamic State\u2019s </span><a href="/web/20161028151304/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/10/26/top-u-s-general-islamic-state-trying-establish-caliphate-afghanistan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drive into Afghanistan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where he said they are doing better than they were in the Middle East.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cWhat is important from their perspective here, this notion of a Caliphate \u2013 whether it\u2019s headquartered in Raqqa in Syria, encompassing the territory they hold in Syria and Iraq, whether it\u2019s in what used to be Libya, whether it\u2019s Boko Haram in Nigeria, whether it\u2019s their chapter in Yemen, or their chapter in Afghanistan \u2013 the notion of a Caliphate requires control of territory, as opposed to al-Qaeda. They don\u2019t pretend to be a Caliphate; they are what they are,\u201d he said.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cSo I think whether this is a conscious plan of ISIS central, whether it\u2019s factions of ISIS looking at what\u2019s happening in Iraq and Syria and going off on their own, I don\u2019t know. But it shows a determination and a relentlessness of these various ISIS factions, that whatever happens in Syria and Iraq, at whatever time Obama finally gets around to it, and/or his successor, ISIS will have succeeded in metastasizing to one or more other locations, and this fight will only continue to get worse,\u201d he predicted. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cYou know, people look at this confusing disorganization within ISIS, the fact that people can be with an al-Qaeda affiliate one day and the week after, they\u2019re with an ISIS affiliate, and act as if that\u2019s a weakness of the terrorists. In fact, I would argue that it\u2019s actually a strength. It shows that the ferment still is there, that they\u2019re still attracting recruits,\u201d he contended.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThey\u2019re having bizarre ideological disagreements among themselves. Look at the history of Vladimir Lenin, and the takeover of Russia after the October Revolution. You can see a lot of parallels \u2013 not ideologically, obviously, but this turmoil in the Muslim world, this civil war as King Abdullah of Jordan has called it, is still very much under way,\u201d Bolton elaborated. \u201cWhatever happens to ISIS in Mosul in the next few weeks and months, whatever happens in Raqqa after that, ISIS \u2013 I\u2019m fearing to say \u2013 is going to be with us for a long time.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the ongoing battle of Mosul, Bolton said that ISS \u201cnot just in Mosul, but across the territory in Iraq that they held previously, for much of the last two years, they have retreated in fairly good order over these months \u2013 from Fallujah, in one little village after another.\u201d He added, \u201cI think it\u2019s clear with the slow pace that the Kurds, and the Peshmerga, and the Iraqi forces, and the Shia militia are proceeding \u2026\xa0that they\u2019re worried that ISIS has prepared a very intricate defense.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThey\u2019ve got potentially thousands of people there who are prepared for martyrdom and to take as many of their opponents with them as they can,\u201d he noted. \u201cAnd obviously there\u2019s a substantial civilian population that remains in Mosul that\u2019s in danger from both sides.\u201d </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThis is an example that the Obama approach, which let ISIS, once it broke out, once the Iraqi army broke before Mosul two years ago, Obama\u2019s slow-roll strategy has given ISIS an enormous amount of time with which to prepare the defenses that we now see unfolding in Mosul,\u201d Bolton charged. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the slowness of the offensive to take back this territory; it\u2019s the days and weeks and months that ISIS has had, through their extraordinary Internet and social media propaganda effort, to recruit new adherents, to train them, to deploy them for terrorist missions in Western Europe and the United States \u2013 and to build up these alternative ISIS bases, if you will, elsewhere around the world. It was clear a long time ago that Obama\u2019s approach of \u2018leading from behind, no-drama Obama, who\u2019s in a rush?\u2019 was simply going to give ISIS a continued advantage. And I\u2019m afraid in Mosul and plenty of other places, that\u2019s what we\u2019re still seeing happening.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turning to Russia, Bolton talked about the new Satan 2 nuclear missile (an ominous name, which Bolton pointed out is actually a Western military designation). He described it as a \u201cMIRV missile,\u201d said that \u201cit used to be the SS-18,\u201d and that \u201cit could hold ten warheads.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cWhile we have been sitting back under the New START treaty, negotiated by Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department for Obama, and we\u2019ve been scaling back, Russia\u2019s been building up. And why shouldn\u2019t they, from their point of view? They meet with no resistance. They get every concession they want in strategic weapons talks. They\u2019re violating treaties like the INF treaty, and have been for some time, with no pushback from the Obama administration,\u201d Bolton said with disgust.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThey don\u2019t fear Hillary Clinton. I think you and I have talked before about this urban legend that somehow Vladimir Putin just can\u2019t wait for Donald Trump to be elected,\u201d he told Marlow. \u201cGood grief! If I were Putin and had to confront a new American president, I\u2019d much rather confront an indecisive, weak, bureaucratic Hillary Clinton than Trump, or any of a lot of other people, for that matter.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThe Russians see they\u2019ve got several more months here until January 20th, at a minimum, where we\u2019re not going to do much of anything to impede their efforts to expand their influence and project power, and I don\u2019t think if Hillary wins, they\u2019re much worried about the four-year period after January the 20th,\u201d he said.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bolton said Hillary Clinton\u2019s tenure as secretary of state \u201cwill go down as part of the larger Obama foreign policy of seeing American influence weakened all over the world.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI think their fatal mistake \u2013 I mean, they made so many, we don\u2019t have time to go through them all \u2013 but their fatal mistake was not understanding the Arab Spring, not understanding that it was not an outbreak of democratic sentiment,\u201d Bolton judged. \u201cIt was really the rise of radical Islam to an even more significant level than anywhere else. And so their policies during the four years she was at the State Department, and in the time since then, have been incoherent. They can\u2019t seem to get a grip on just exactly what it is they want.\u201d </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cLook at Egypt as one example, where they supported Mubarak, then they wanted Mubarak overthrown. Then they said, \u2018Well, let\u2019s postpone it. Let\u2019s have elections.\u2019 That brings the Muslim Brotherhood to power, and they say, \u2018Well, maybe that wasn\u2019t such a great idea.\u2019 And the net-net is now, after all this time, almost nobody in Egypt trusts the administration, and the Russians have been expanding their influence,\u201d he said.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cIn Syria, we\u2019ve seen the extraordinary circumstance of Russia building a new airbase in Latakia, just a few minutes\u2019 flying time from the northern border of Israel. Unfortunately, whoever the next president is, it\u2019s not enough just to say, \u2018Okay, I guess we\u2019ll reverse the Obama administration\u2019s policies\u2019 because the Russians, among others, have created facts on the ground that you can\u2019t just snap your fingers and wish away. We are in a worse position today, across the Middle East, than we were on January 20, 2009, and I don\u2019t think Hillary has a clue how to change that,\u201d said Bolton.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He did not entirely agree with Donald Trump\u2019s warning that Hillary Clinton would </span><a href="/web/20161028151304/http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/26/donald-trump-hillarys-syria-policy-lead-world-war-three/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">usher in World War III</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with her Syria policy, but he warned that \u201cwhether it\u2019s Obama or Clinton, the weakness of the United States invites confrontation and challenge from our adversaries.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cWhen they think we\u2019re growing weaker, they see the chance to advance their agenda,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a miscalculation on their part of fundamental American strength, and maybe even a miscalculation of the steel and the spine even of Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton. It\u2019s when you\u2019re sending mixed signals, and signals of weakness, that your adversaries are most likely to miscalculate, and it\u2019s a miscalculation that\u2019s most likely to lead to war: an incident at sea of a Russian plane buzzing our ships, of coming too close in firing missiles from the Houthi rebels at U.S. destroyers in the Red Sea. You can see how these incidents can escalate.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cIf they faced a strong president, they wouldn\u2019t even engage in this kind of harassment, and the risk of a miscalculation would be lower,\u201d Bolton contended. \u201cSo I think continued American decline </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">does </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">increase the risk of hostilities because it\u2019s not American strength that\u2019s provocative; it\u2019s American weakness that\u2019s provocative.\u201d</span></p>, <p><em>Breitbart News Daily</em> airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m.\xa0to 9:00 a.m.\xa0Eastern.</p>, <p><strong>LISTEN:</strong></p>, <p><iframe frameborder="no" height="400" scrolling="no" src="/web/20161028151304if_/https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F290227425&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;maxwidth=990&amp;maxheight=1000" width="990"></iframe></p>]
