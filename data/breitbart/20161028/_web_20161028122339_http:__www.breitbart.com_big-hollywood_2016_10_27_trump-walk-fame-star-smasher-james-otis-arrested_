The man could be seen wearing a construction worker\u2019s uniform in a <a href="/web/20161028152732/http://deadline.com/2016/10/donald-trump-hollywood-walk-of-fame-star-destroyed-video-1201842969/" target="_blank">video obtained exclusively</a> by entertainment news website Deadline Hollywood.</p>, <p>The LAPD\u2019s Hollywood division was preparing a press release with additional information Thursday morning. Otis said Wednesday that he had spoken with the LAPD and had been preparing to turn himself in.</p>, <p>In an <a href="/web/20161028152732/http://www.dailynews.com/general-news/20161026/man-who-vandalized-donald-trumps-star-speaks-out-i-was-just-so-fed-up" target="_blank">interview with the <em>Los Angeles Daily News</em></a> published Thursday, Otis, describes himself as a \u201cBernie Democrat\u201d who plans to vote for Hillary Clinton in the general election in November. The man said he originally planned to remove the star from the Walk intact and auction it off to benefit the women who have accused the Republican presidential candidate of sexual assault.</p>, <p>\u201cI was just so fed up, so saddened and fed up by Mr. Trump and how he continues to denigrate women, and he continues to joke and make fun about sexual violence and his own exploits against women,\u201d Otis told the Daily News. \u201cAnd personally, I have in my own family, several people who have been sexually assaulted, including my brother and it hurts a lot. It doesn\u2019t go away. It\u2019s an issue that\u2019s very important to me.\u201d</p>, <p>Otis, who says he has a real estate business and also teaches non-violent social theory, said he had planned the attack on Trump\u2019s star for about six weeks.</p>, <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a big joke to him. I have children; I have many women in my life who don\u2019t think it\u2019s a joke. But he does,\u201d Otis told the Daily News when asked what message he would like to tell Trump. \u201cHe lies about it, he shuffles and I don\u2019t see, there\u2019s no reason to believe at all that it will ever stop now. He\u2019ll continue to do this, he\u2019ll continue to make women suffer. So that\u2019s what I\u2019d tell him. \u201cYou need help. Please understand that.\u201d</p>, <p>\xa0</p>, <p><em>Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: <a href="/web/20161028152732/https://twitter.com/dznussbaum" target="_blank">@dznussbaum</a></em></p>]
