[<p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Second of Three Parts</span></strong></p>, <p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">by Virgil, with Theodore Roosevelt</span></strong></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">In <a href="/web/20161028122632/http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/26/att-time-warner-deal-perspective-great-trustbuster/"><span class="s2">Part One</span></a> of this series, I described the curious partisan inversion that has occurred in the wake of the proposed AT&amp;T-Time Warner deal: Donald Trump has come out against it, and Hillary Clinton appears to be, quietly in favor of it.\xa0 In other words, the Republican presidential nominee, representing the supposed party of big business, is now on the \u201canti-corporate\u201d side, while the Democratic presidential nominee, representing the supposed party of ordinary working people, is seemingly on the \u201cpro-corporate\u201d side.\xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">To help me wrestle with the implications of this improbable flip, I, ghost that I am, have turned to another ghost.\xa0 Namely, the shade of Theodore Roosevelt, America\u2019s 26th president, serving from 1901 to 1909. \xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">In his day, Roosevelt\u2014like Trump, a rich New York City-born Protestant\u2014was also an improbable figure.\xa0 He was a war hero, a sub-cabinet appointee in two Republican administrations, and was also, in 1898, elected governor of New York State.\xa0 Yet even so, he was out of step with many, perhaps most, of his fellow Republicans on key issues\u2014in particular, business regulation.\xa0 Notably, TR was a critic of the Republican stand-pat attitude toward business abuses.\xa0 And, not to put too fine a point on it, he viewed orthodox Republicanism as retrograde and reactionary, hopelessly outmoded in an era of rapidly swelling national needs. \xa0 \xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Roosevelt was elected to the vice presidency in 1900, and while that was certainly an honor for him, it was also seen, by New York\u2019s Republican political bosses, as a clever way of getting him out of Albany\u2014and out of their hair.\xa0 Nobody foresaw that President William McKinley would be assassinated in September 1901, thus elevating TR to the presidency.\xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">In office, one of President Roosevelt\u2019s trademarks was his association with \u201ctrustbusting\u201d\u2014that is, antitrust enforcement, which was seen as a necessary response to the corporate behemoths that had grown to dominance in the mostly unregulated 19th century.\xa0 Indeed, it was common to see <a href="/web/20161028122632/http://www.cfm-online.com/federal-lobbying-blog/2016/3/14/28l562kik47120rkg8eik3rk53goea"><span class="s2">political cartoons</span></a> of TR as a muscular trustbuster, personally battling piratical tycoons.\xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">And while Roosevelt passed from earth\u2019s mortal coil in 1919, happily for me, he still pays close attention to the news.\xa0 \xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">So amidst the rolling mists of Eternity, as <i>Breitbart</i>\u2019s most roving of roving correspondents, I was pleased to score an exclusive interview with The Colonel.\xa0 (Yes, he liked to be called that, because, of all the many things he did in his life, he was most proud of his service with the First US Volunteer Cavalry Regiment\u2014a unit he had formed\u2014in Cuba during the Spanish-American War.\xa0 His daring 1898 charge up San Juan Hill in broad daylight, against the entrenched Spanish infantry, ultimately earned him a <a href="/web/20161028122632/http://www.cmohs.org/recipient-detail/2178/roosevelt-theodore.php"><span class="s2">Congressional Medal of Honor</span></a>.)\xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">So what follows is a transcript of my interview with Roosevelt:\xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Virgil: Mr. President, Colonel, thanks for taking time to speak with me.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Theodore Roosevelt: Oh, enough with the formal folderol, Virgil!\xa0 Or else I\u2019ll start calling you \u201cPublius Vergilius Mero.\u201d\xa0 So please, just call me \u201cTheodore.\u201d\xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">V: Okay.\xa0 You prefer \u201cTheodore,\u201d not \u201cTeddy\u201d? \xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">TR: Yes . . . I haven\u2019t liked \u201cTeddy\u201d for a long time.\xa0 [Virgil has since learned that Roosevelt\u2019s first wife, Alice, had called him \u201cTeddy\u201d; after she died in 1884, he didn\u2019t wish to hear that nickname any more.]</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">V: Got it.\xa0 Well, uh, in any case, the subject at hand is big corporations and their combinations.\xa0 So I\u2019ll get right to it: What do you think of AT&amp;T\u2019s pending purchase of Time Warner?\xa0 I mean, as a famous trustbuster, you always had an unorthodox view of antitrust for a Republican.\xa0 So now, do you agree with Donald Trump?</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">TR: Actually, skepticism about big corporations and their doings is not quite so unorthodox for Republicans as you might think.\xa0 I was always, I would say, part of a strong tradition within the Party.\xa0 Since its inception in 1854, there has always been that tradition of skepticism about big business among many Republicans.\xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">V: Gee, I hadn\u2019t known that.\xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">TR: Yes. The Grand Old Party, when it was, in fact, the Grand <i>New</i> Party, got its start on Main Street, in <a href="/web/20161028122632/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripon,_Wisconsin"><span class="s2">Ripon, Wisconsin</span></a>, to be precise, back in 1854.\xa0 To be sure, others claim that honor for another small town, <a href="/web/20161028122632/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Michigan"><span class="s2">Jackson, Michigan</span></a>. \xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet either way, Ripon or Jackson, the Republican Party most definitely got its start among the farmers, free laborers, and merchants of the Midwest, not on Wall Street.\xa0 To put it another way, the GOP was the little-guy party, at a time when the Democratic Party\u2014which had its own populist tradition, going back to Andrew Jackson\u2014had been taken over by the Southern plantation slaveowners.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">V: Hmm.\xa0 I had always thought of the Republicans as the party of robber-baron railroad tycoons.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">TR: Yes. that\u2019s a common misconception.\xa0 Oh sure, the railroads were a big factor.\xa0 Particularly in the North, which had industrialized sooner than the South, the railroads were akin to what Silicon Valley is today\u2014the vital infrastructure of the age, as well as an economic locomotive, if you\u2019ll pardon the wordplay.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">And yet precisely because the railroads were so huge, they had a massive influence on <i>both</i> parties.\xa0 When <a href="/web/20161028122632/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelius_Vanderbilt"><span class="s2">Commodore Vanderbilt</span></a>, owner of a half-dozen big railroads, wanted to take control of the New York State legislature and use it for his personal gain, he just showed up in Albany with a trunk full of cash, doling it out to whomever would do his bidding, regardless of partisan label.\xa0 And that was true across the country. \xa0 \xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet even so, as often as not, the early Republicans were true to their roots among the workingmen, even if that conflicted with the interests of the railroadmen.\xa0 For example, here are the words of the first Republican president, <a href="/web/20161028122632/http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=29502"><span class="s2">Abraham Lincoln</span></a>, in his message to Congress, December 3, 1861.\xa0 As you can see, Honest Abe was explicit about the greater importance of labor over capital:</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Labor is prior to and independent of capital. Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed.\xa0 Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher consideration.\xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">V: Interesting.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">TR:\xa0 Now it\u2019s worth pointing out that Lincoln actually had been a lawyer for the railroads back in Illinois in the 1850s.\xa0 Moreover, by his own bootstrapping nature, he was a strong believer in private property and free enterprise.\xa0 However, he saw something crucial: There had to be a <i>balance</i> between capital and labor, and the government\u2014hopefully, a Republican government\u2014had to calibrate that balance, always making sure that the interests of workers and small landholders were protected.</span></p>, <p>Lincoln\u2019s idea of balance held true for labor relations, such as they were, and it held true, also, for the general management of the economy, including imports and foreign trade.\xa0 Interestingly, the most influential American economist of the 19th century was a man who was a believer in capitalism and property, but at the same time, a staunch opponent of unregulated <em>laissez-faire</em>.</p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">V: Who was that?\xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">TR: <a href="/web/20161028122632/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Henry-C-Carey"><span class="s2">Henry C. Carey</span></a>.\xa0 He\u2019s a man forgotten today, but his 1851 <i>magnum opus</i>, <a href="/web/20161028122632/http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/authors/search/?query=Carey,+Henry+Charles"><span class="s2">The Harmony of Interests: Agricultural, Manufacturing, and Commercial</span></a> communicates its essence in its title: A happy country needs rules and guidelines that keep all sectors in harmony.\xa0 In other words, rules.\xa0 Carey was a conservative, ideologically, but at the same time, he could see the necessity of governmental action to preserve equilibrium. \xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">You see, unlike today, when many Republicans regard the free market as the solution for everything, back then, Republicans thought more about social harmonies.\xa0 That is, they were <i>conservatives</i>.\xa0 After all, the hallmark of conservatism has been its reverence for such non-market-based concepts and institutions as culture, tradition, and church.\xa0 By contrast, those who bow down to the market, only, inevitably see everything as being for sale\u2014the only issue is the price.\xa0 And that\u2019s a very different concept.\xa0 \xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">V: Interesting.\xa0 And yet today\u2019s \u201cconservatives\u201d mostly pride themselves on their devotion to the free market.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">TR: Those who are devoted to the free market\u2014above God, country, and family\u2014are really <i>libertarians</i>, not conservatives.\xa0 That is, they are the followers of a liberal tradition; they want to liberalize and liberate things\u2014everything. \xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">V: Really?\xa0 I hadn\u2019t thought of it that way. \xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">TR: Yes, there\u2019s a recent phrase, coined by an avowed libertarian at the Cato Institute, seeking to instantiate this ultimate unity: He has called this synthesis \u201c<a href="/web/20161028122632/http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/liberaltarians"><span class="s2">liberaltarian</span></a>.\u201d\xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">V: Fascinating.\xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">TR: So back to Lincoln.\xa0 He was an emancipator, for sure, but was always mostly a conservative.\xa0 As an aside, I\u2019ll note that in <a href="/web/20161028122632/http://www.bartleby.com/124/pres31.html"><span class="s2">his first inaugural address</span></a>, Lincoln offered an extended hymn to our sacred union.\xa0 It was a strictly <i>conservative</i> peroration, a celebration of non-monetary values; it had nothing at all to do with market forces.\xa0 Have a listen:\xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">V: I see, good point.\xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">TR: Okay, so now, more on Lincoln\u2019s conservative economics, which were, always, focused on balance and harmony.\xa0 Even as he praised labor and described it as \u201cprior\u201d to capital, he was also eager to make room for capital, too.\xa0 In that same 1861 speech to Congress, he said:</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Capital has its rights, which are as worthy of protection as any other rights.\xa0 Nor is it denied that there is, and probably always will be, a relation between labor and capital producing mutual benefits.\xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Again, that\u2019s the point: mutual benefits\u2014<i>harmony</i>.\xa0 His goal, and the goal of all conservatives, is actually to have no class warfare and no civil war.\xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">V: Although, of course, tragically, America got both.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">TR: Yes, those were tumultuous times.\xa0 But Lincoln and the Republicans, I am proud to say, managed to steer the ship of state through those stormy seas to safe harbor.\xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">V: Okay, that\u2019s an interesting history lesson.\xa0 So what about antitrust? \xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">TR: My dear man, you asked me a question, and I am answering it.\xa0 Give me time!\xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">V: Yes, sir.\xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">TR: As the 19th century moved along, it became apparent that more had to be done to curb the power of what was becoming Big Business.\xa0 That is, not just the railroads, but all the corporate \u201ctrusts,\u201d as we called them back then.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">And once again, in formulating the national response, it was Republicans who took the lead.\xa0 The <a href="/web/20161028122632/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act"><span class="s2">Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890</span></a> was authored by Sen. John Sherman of Ohio, a Republican.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">V: The brother of William Tecumseh Sherman, the Union general in the Civil War?\xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">TR: Yes, quite so. They were both good men.\xa0 And the Sherman Act, I might add, was signed into law by a Republican president, Benjamin Harrison.\xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">V: So you\u2019re saying that antitrust is a Republican cause?\xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">TR: At times, it has been, and then, at times, not.\xa0 To borrow the phrase from the poet Walt Whitman, the Republican Party, like the Democratic Party, \u201ccontains multitudes.\u201d \xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">And so now, in this historical quickmarch, let\u2019s now skip ahead a few years, to 1896.\xa0 In that year, we saw the election of a great man, William McKinley.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">V: Hmm.\xa0 If you say so.\xa0 Isn\u2019t McKinley, the 25th president, remembered as a tool of big business, a puppet in the hands of his puppet-master, the industrial magnate <a href="/web/20161028122632/https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=mark+hannah&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;q=Mark+Hanna&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgecTozC3w8sc9YSmrSWtOXmM04eIKzsgvd80rySypFFLjYoOyZLh4pTj1c_UNDE2zysw1GKS4uRBcHgAS6nToSAAAAA"><span class="s2">Mark Hanna</span></a>?\xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">TR: Yes, unfortunately, that <i>is</i> the way President McKinley is remembered, and it\u2019s neither a fair nor accurate memory.\xa0 He was in reality a talented fellow, who, when young, was forced by financial exigency to drop out of college; he then worked as a postal clerk and schoolteacher before enlisting as a private in the Union Army in 1861.\xa0 And after four years of bloody combat, he had risen to the rank of major.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Later he was elected to Congress from Ohio, and then, in \u201996, to the presidency.\xa0 And, once in the White House, President McKinley was then kind enough to select me as his running mate in 1900 when he sought re-election.\xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">V: And after the McKinley-Roosevelt ticket was victorious, he was assassinated.\xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">TR: Yes, he died on September 14, 1901; it was a terrible tragedy.\xa0 <a href="/web/20161028122632/http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=29542"><span class="s2">As I said to Congress after his death</span></a>, \u201cHe was the most widely loved man in all the United States\u201d\u2014except of course, by one evil anarchist, Leon Czolgosz, whom we nowadays would call a \u201cterrorist.\u201d\xa0 Moreover, in paying tribute to my boss and my friend, I reminded my audience that he was no economic royalist but, rather, a true cloth-coat Republican:\xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">President McKinley was a man of moderate means, a man whose stock sprang from the sturdy tillers of the soil, who had himself belonged among the wage-workers.\xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">V: Okay, you\u2019ve convinced me: There were plenty of lunchpail Republicans back then.\xa0<b> </b>So how did this image of the Republicans as the party of plutocracy get started?\xa0 Has it all been media bias? \xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">TR: As I said, Main Street Republicanism was one strand of the Party.\xa0 Another strand was Big Business and Wall Street Republicanism. \xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">And within the GOP, the big shots, too, had their champions, such as the dreadful <a href="/web/20161028122632/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_W._Aldrich"><span class="s2">Sen. Nelson Aldrich</span></a> of Rhode Island, whose daughter married John D. Rockefeller, Jr.\xa0 Aldrich was a reactionary, or, as I liked to call him and his ilk, a \u201cmalefactor of great wealth.\u201d\xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">V: So there were two Republican parties, or sub-parties, or factions. \xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">TR: Yes. I was astride one, and Aldrich was astride the other.\xa0 And we fought like the dickens.\xa0 When I was a young man, back in the 1880s,\xa0 the reactionary faction was known as the \u201cStalwarts,\u201d and as for the progressive faction, we were called \u201cHalf-Breeds.\u201d\xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">V: I guess \u201cHalf-Breed\u201d is too politically incorrect for this era.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">TR: Yes, I suppose so.\xa0 But by any terminological dichotomy\u2014Main Street vs. Wall Street, mossback vs. reformer, conservative vs. progressive\u2014the split has been real and ongoing, stretching out as it has\xa0 a century-and-a-half.\xa0 Both sides have had their victories and their defeats.\xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">From my vantage point in the Oval Office\u2014that was a structure, by the way, that I added to the White House, as part of the West Wing, in 1902\u2014I could see that the rising tide of discontent had to be dealt with in a constructive manner. \xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">You see, William Jennings Bryan, a fire-breathing populist whom I loathed, had taken over the Democratic Party in 1896.\xa0 Bryan had some good ideas, such as the advancement of workers\u2019 rights, but he was also irresponsible\u2014I thought of him as a danger to the republic.\xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Happily, McKinley beat Bryan in the \u201996 presidential election, and again in \u201900, and yet even so, it was obvious that Bryan had a substantial constituency; the populist upswell was going to continue, because economic conditions were harsh and times were indeed hard. \xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">So something had to be done to improve the lot of workers and farmers, all the while maintaining the basic order of things.\xa0 And I felt that I was the man to do it.\xa0 I called my policy program the Square Deal.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">V: Sounds a bit like the New Deal of Franklin D. Roosevelt.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">TR: Well, Franklin was my cousin and, I daresay, a fan of mine.\xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">V: In any case, whatever the name, your goal was to stave off all that populist energy.\xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">TR: Yes, exactly.\xa0 But I knew that I couldn\u2019t stop domestic radicalism with reaction\u2014that just feeds it.\xa0 Instead, I had to stop radicalism with prudent preemption. \xa0 As I think Edmund Burke said, the task of the statesman is to channel the tides of change through the canals of custom.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">V: Ooh, I like that. \xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">TR: Yes, I love Burke. \xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">V: So now to antitrust?\xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">TR: I\u2019m getting there!</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">In that same message to Congress in 1901, delivered just three months after I was sworn into office, I took the antitrust issue head on.\xa0 I began by reiterating the basic conservative Republican wisdom of the harmony of interests, because, ultimately, all Americans are in the same boat.\xa0 As I said:</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">The fundamental rule in our national life\u2013the rule which underlies all others\u2013is that, on the whole, and in the long run, we shall go up or down together.\xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">I might note that that\u2019s the sort of \u201cOne Nation\u201d rhetoric used a few decades before by the great British conservative leader and prime minister, Benjamin Disraeli.\xa0 That was his big idea: He could not let his country sunder, split apart, over class divisions and class warfare.\xa0 And that\u2019s exactly what I thought, too.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">And yet at the same time, in our search for solutions, we couldn\u2019t go blundering around, armed only by sentiments, as opposed to sapience. \xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">V: I love latinate words!</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">TR: As I also said:</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">The mechanism of modern business is so delicate that extreme care must be taken not to interfere with it in a spirit of rashness or ignorance.\xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">V: Okay, got it.\xa0 But again, where does antitrust fit in? \xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">TR: Virgil, you seem to be in rather a hurry.
