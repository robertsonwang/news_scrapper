The Associated Press <a href="/web/20161028124810/http://www.foxnews.com/health/2016/10/19/hand-foot-and-mouth-disease-reported-on-illinois-campus.html" target="_blank">reported</a> last week that the\xa0University of Illinois has seen more than 60 cases of HFMD\xa0among students since the beginning of the semester.</p>, <p>HFMD is a virus that presents through the appearance of painful blisters on hands and feet. The illness is most commonly caused by the Coxsackie A16 virus, which is a member of a group of enteroviruses. It can be spread through fecal or oral transmission, which makes children\u2019s daycare centers and college dorms common transmission areas.</p>, <p>There is no vaccine for\xa0HFMD. However, since it is viral, cleanliness may decrease the chances of contracting the illness, which usually lasts for up to\xa010 days after contact.</p>, <p>The virus has also elicited reactions on social media:</p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">Wife and daughter are sick with <a href="/web/20161028124810/https://twitter.com/hashtag/hfmd?src=hash">#hfmd</a> and <a href="/web/20161028124810/https://twitter.com/hashtag/strep?src=hash">#strep</a> <a href="/web/20161028124810/https://twitter.com/hashtag/sickness?src=hash">#sickness</a> <a href="/web/20161028124810/https://twitter.com/hashtag/sick?src=hash">#sick</a> my best friend is Lysol\u2026 <a href="/web/20161028124810/https://t.co/u6kGqeRI1a">pic.twitter.com/u6kGqeRI1a</a></p>, <p>\u2014 Shannon Duncan (@iamMrDuncan) <a href="/web/20161028124810/https://twitter.com/iamMrDuncan/status/787318319560871936">October 15, 2016</a></p>, <p><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="/web/20161028124810js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></p>, <p>HMFD is sometimes confused with hoof and mouth disease, which only affects livestock like pigs, cattle and sheep.
