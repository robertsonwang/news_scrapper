[<p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>Unless you\u2019ve got $599 for the Oculus Rift, or $799 for Valve\u2019s HTC Vive, your pass into the frontier of early virtual reality experiences has necessarily remained a digital dream. According to Microsoft, that\u2019s all changing very soon.</p>, <p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>Acer, Asus, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, and Lenovo are among the third-party manufacturers helping Microsoft to launch their own line of affordable VR headsets. How affordable? The starting price point is half that of the Oculus Rift, at a much less eye-watering $299.</p>, <p>Executive VP of Windows and Devices Terry Myerson claims that the new headsets will also avoid elaborate setup, as the first headset to launch with \u201cinside-out six degrees of freedom sensors.\u201d This is a notable upgrade in both ease of use and overall quality of life for new and veteran users alike.

There is, however, a \u201cHolotour\u201d of various locales\xa0that could be a very zen experience for would-be world travelers.</p>, <p>Can Microsoft\u2019s focus on affordability and accessibility overcome the Oculus and Valve head starts? Will the headset itself be robust enough to offer the same level of experience? Will third party software embrace another major entry into the industry? We have a lot of questions, and this is just the beginning.</p>, <p><em>Follow\xa0Nate\xa0Church\xa0</em><a class=" x5l" href="/web/20161028124326/https://twitter.com/Get2Church" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>@Get2Church</em></a><em>\xa0on Twitter for the latest news in gaming and technology, and snarky opinions on both.</em></p>]
