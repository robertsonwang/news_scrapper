[<p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>In December 2014, <a href="/web/20161028142955/https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/33082">Sullivan wrote</a> to now-campaign chairman Podesta and Philippe Reines about an off-the-record conversation with Gearan, who reportedly praised Clinton as a candidate while trying to gather information on the 2016 campaign.</p>, <p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>Funny \u2014 I just met with Anne Gearan. She didn\u2019t even mention she was working on a piece. We talked about a bunch of things off the record, mostly me b.s.\u2019ing about great HRC is in a thousand different ways. She was very focused on who is getting hired for what, which I pled (accurate) ignorance on. She was also very focused on timing for the campaign, which I also pled ignorance on. She believes Benghazi is a bigger liability than others think. You all know my views on this \u2014 though I made a strong case to the contrary. <strong>She professed to be a big fan \u2014 someone who believes that HRC grew at State and is better, warmer, and more formidable as a candidate now.</strong></p>, <p>Months later, <a href="/web/20161028142955/https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/14193">Huma Abedin reported</a> that Gearan joined\xa0a chorus of journalists who commended Clinton for a display of humility at the 2015 Toner Prize award ceremony:</p>, <p>Andrea mitchell, laura meckler, jon allen, anne gearan, phil rucker, karen tumulty in unison agreed that she did the right thing and appreciated that she \u201cacknowledged\u201d that she has a problematic relationship with the press.</p>, <p>\xa0</p>, <p>Other email threads show a chummy relationship between Gearan and Podesta. She apparently <a href="/web/20161028142955/http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2016/10/17/wikileaks-journalists-clinton-staff-homes-before-hillarys-campaign-launch/">RSVPed \u201cyes\u201d</a> to an off-the-record dinner at Podesta\u2019s house three days before the campaign\u2019s launch \u2014 joining dozens of reporters who would become part of Clinton\u2019s travelling press pool.</p>, <p>In June 2015, she profiled the campaign\u2019s early days, framing Hillary for America as disciplined, \u201ctightwad,\u201d and distinct from \u201cWashington powerbrokers.\u201d The illustration of this message was that Podesta and other staffers <a href="/web/20161028142955/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/06/09/how-cheap-is-hillary-clintons-campaign-this-cheap/">rode commercial buses</a> from New York to DC. The article hyped Clinton \u201crunning as a warrior for the middle class.\u201d Campaign press secretary <a href="/web/20161028142955/https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/30410">Brian Fallon told Podesta</a> that Gearan would angle her questions on that very thesis: \u201c[she will be] asking you to articulate how the bus is a symbol of the campaign\u2019s disciplined approach,\u201d he wrote.</p>, <p>When the Post published Gearan\u2019s article, she <a href="/web/20161028142955/https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/31447">emailed a link</a> to Podesta with the subject line: \u201cThanks again for the company and conversation.\u201d</p>, <p>A <a href="/web/20161028142955/https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/32503">new email thread</a> published Wednesday shows Gearan reminiscing about the bus story and pitching another soft-focus campaign profile \u2014 centered on Podesta\u2019s cooking skills. In February 2016, she wrote to Podesta and campaign communications director Jennifer Palmieri:</p>, <p>Hi John and Jennifer,</p>, <p>In Iowa, John had suggested that since I now know how he behaves on a bus I should see how he does in the kitchen at one of your cooking fundraisers. Assuming you were serious I really want to do this. It would be a fun feature amid the chaos.</p>, <p>How about the one below? [\u201ca Campaign Briefing and Brunch with John Podesta, Campaign Chair and Special Guest Chef, Carla Hall Co-Host of ABC\u2019s The Chew\u201d on February 21st] With Melina [Mara] for photos of you slinging a whisk?</p>, <p>Ground rules could be a few ways, but I would need to be able to quote both you and Ms. Hall and to ask guests for comment.</p>, <p>Let me know, and cheers.</p>, <p>Gearan said Wednesday afternoon that, per her recollection two years later, Sullivan\u2019s contemporaneous description of their conversation was inaccurate \u2014 objecting to\xa0Twitter accounts using\xa0the email to ridicule her. She insisted that she has covered Clinton impartially.</p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="/web/20161028142955/https://twitter.com/KazeSkyz">@KazeSkyz</a> <a href="/web/20161028142955/https://twitter.com/NolteNC">@NolteNC</a> Assume u know I have never "professed to be a big fan."
