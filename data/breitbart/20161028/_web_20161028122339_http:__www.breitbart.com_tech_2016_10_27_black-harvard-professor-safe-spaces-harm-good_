[<p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>James Sidanius, a Harvard University professor of psychology and African-American studies, <a href="/web/20161028124458/http://www.thecollegefix.com/post/29635/">argued</a>\xa0in 2004 that giving minority groups safe spaces only serves to damage their relationships with other ethnic groups on campus.</p>, <p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>Sidanius published a 2004 paper entitled \u201cEthnic Enclaves and the Dynamics of Social Identity on the College Campus: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,\u201d in which he deconstructed the argument that minorities groups need private spaces on campus in order to thrive.</p>, <p>\u201cI don\u2019t see any signs that [ethnic enclaves have] gotten worse, it\u2019s probably remained relatively constant, we\u2019re just paying more attention to it now,\u201d he told The College Fix recently.</p>, <p>Sidanius\xa0analyzed the effect that belonging to such groups as the Black Student Union had on students over time. His research revealed that belonging to ethnic groups on campus caused \u201can increased sense of ethnic victimization and a decreased sense of common identity and social inclusiveness\u201d on participating students.</p>, <p>\u201cOnce having joined these [ethnic] organizations, the more likely [students] were to feel that they were in this zero-sum relationship with other ethnic groups on campus, and the greater level of hostility they had towards other members on campus, the greater the degree to which they felt ethnically victimized by other ethnic groups on campus,\u201d Sidanius claimed.</p>, <p>Although his research was conducted in 2004, Sidanius claims that his findings are still relevant today, especially considering the recent increase in demand for ethnically-exclusively spaces on campus.</p>, <p>Sidanius concludes that \u201camong minority students, the evidence suggested that membership in ethnically oriented student organizations actually increased the perception that ethnic groups are locked into zero-sum competition with one another and the feeling of victimization by virtue of one\u2019s ethnicity.\u201d</p>, <p><em><em>Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about Free Speech and Intellectual Diversity for Breitbart.
