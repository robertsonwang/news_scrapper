[<p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>On a drizzly Monday morning in mid-September, about 200 staffers from the Koch brothers\u2019 conservative advocacy network were summoned to the fifth floor auditorium of the Charles Koch Institute\u2019s Arlington, Virginia, headquarters, and presented with some bleak news: their efforts to reshape American politics were faltering and were being scaled back amid concerns about lower-than-projected fundraising.</p>, <p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>In recent years, the deep-pocketed network\u2019s forays into federal elections and policy fights had resulted in \u201cvery little success,\u201d the managers were told by top Koch official Mark Holden, according to three people familiar with the meeting.</p>, <p>The Koch brothers\u2019 <a href="/web/20161028152246/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_family" target="_blank">great wealth</a> was honestly earned in the unforgiving energy sector, where careless progressive dreamers quickly get blown up, bankrupted and forgotten. So the green-eyeshade politics promoted by Charles Koch and David Koch are a rational match for their business needs \u2014 they favor small governments, low taxes, low spending, and free trade, plus egalitarian social policies that gradually overlap with the progressives\u2019 radical demands for <a href="/web/20161028152246/http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/09/18/mcdonalds-hires-foreign-h-1bs-fires-70-american-accounting-staff/" target="_blank">unlimited immigration</a> and <a href="/web/20161028152246/http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/21/n-c-gop-governor-closes-polling-gap-as-transgender-demand-mobilizes-conservative-voters/" target="_blank">sexual revolution</a>.</p>, <p>But the 2016 election shows that the Koch\u2019s package of business and politics, however productive and principled, is no longer good enough for most Americans.
