He said he had secured contracts for the former president that would pay out $66 million over the subsequent nine years if the deals remained in place.</p>, <p>For instance, Band wrote that Kelly arranged for the former president to meet the chief executive of Coca-Cola in January 2009 at the Clintons\u2019 home in Washington. In all, according to Band\u2019s memo, Coke had contributed $4.33 million to the foundation between 2004 and 2010.</p>, <p><a href="/web/20161028153150/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/27/us/politics/bill-hillary-clinton-foundation-wikileaks.html?_r=0">New York Times</a> \u2014 The Times dedicates only two paragraphs to the memo in an overview of the Clinton Foundation\u2019s mentions in Wikileaks.

In exchange for the latter contribution, Band wrote, the former president attended a Dow dinner in Davos, Switzerland.</p>]
