[<p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engelbrecht said her organization takes reports of fraud seriously, including </span><a href="/web/20161028145336/http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2016/10/25/texas-county-switches-paper-ballots-software-glitch/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent accounts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of voting machines in Texas marking Hillary Clinton for president on \u201cstraight Republican\u201d ballots.</span></p>, <p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cWhat we\u2019re hearing out of the counties now is that the vote switching is being chalked up to user error,\u201d she reported. \u201cMaybe, maybe not, but it was good to see the county official come out and make a very important statement, and that is for all of us: when you go and vote, make sure that your ballot reflects the people that you intended to vote for, and if it doesn\u2019t, don\u2019t leave the polling place and say, \u2018Gosh, I hope somebody figures that out\u2019 because it won\u2019t be cast correctly.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cIt\u2019s really no surprise that we\u2019re seeing these kinds of problems. We\u2019ve got a process that is prehistoric by comparison to other countries, in the way that we\u2019ve let technology get away from us. It\u2019s engineered obsolescence, and we played right into it,\u201d she said.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI think one of the challenges that we face is that we have electronic systems that are out there new in the field, that have been put out by George Soros\u2019 companies, and then we have other systems that are out there, like here in parts of Texas, where I\u2019m calling from today, that haven\u2019t been updated since Windows XP. That\u2019s their operating system underpinning, and that\u2019s not even supported. Great news is you can\u2019t hack those,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s the range of disparity along this continuum.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI spent some time two years ago \u2013 I went to Mexico City to understand how they vote in Mexico. Frankly, it was because I got sick of the rhetoric, all this pushback about voter ID, and that people coming in from Latin-American countries couldn\u2019t possibly get ID. Well, the reality is, every industrialized country in the world has a mandatory form of voter ID, except the United States,\u201d Engelbrecht said.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cIn any case, I went to Mexico to see how they did it. They use paper ballots, but the paper ballots are encrypted at a level of sophistication equivalent to legal tender, with the strip that runs through, with the programming specific to one ballot. It\u2019s a very sophisticated system, and they found a balance of security and liberty,\u201d she concluded.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI think that\u2019s really our challenge in the coming months and years, is to make this a priority,\u201d she urged. \u201cEasy to pay it lip service, when we\u2019re in the straightaway now of a major election, but mark my words: everybody that gets elected gets elected, and all of a sudden they turn their attentions to other things; the system works for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">them</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Anybody that loses and talks about it, well, they\u2019re crying over spilled milk. What that really means is, it\u2019s up to the citizens to say, \u2018Hey, wait a second, if it was important before the election; it\u2019s still important now. And if there were no solutions, then we still have this open wound that has to be dealt with, because it\u2019s the underpinning of everything else we discuss. It\u2019s a very real problem.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engelbrecht found early voting \u201cproblematic from top to bottom.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI understand the convenience, trust me. It\u2019s great for people that want to go and volunteer to work on Election Day because they can vote first. I get all of that. However, what we\u2019re seeing is this slide where you\u2019ve got well over half \u2013 seventy, eighty percent \u2013 of states that are voting before the debate\u2019s over, if you will, before we\u2019ve really had an opportunity to kind of set the table of ideas. You\u2019ve got states that are voting a month before Election Day,\u201d she said.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cFurther, you\u2019ve got states that are all mail-in, so there\u2019s never an opportunity to go and see eyeballs of another citizen working at the polls, and have that experience,\u201d she continued. \u201cWhat happens in those environments is a lack of check and balance that erodes the security, the stability of the process. You have no way of really knowing who\u2019s casting those paper ballots in that mail-in fashion or early elections. You have no way, really, of capturing the full attention because it\u2019s going on for so long.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She cited studies that show \u201clonger early election periods actually diminish turnout because it has an impact on people that signal to them it\u2019s not important because it just kind of goes on forever, and it loses its significance.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engelbrecht talked about </span><a href="/web/20161028145336/http://www.votestand.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VoteStand</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a new smartphone app </span><a href="/web/20161028145336/http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2016/10/25/true-vote-offers-smartphone-app-report-voter-fraud/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">released by True the Vote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that will allow users to report voting irregularities.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cWe developed this app really as an outfall of our own volunteer experiences, where people go to the polls, they see things that happen in the flash of an eye, they don\u2019t know how to capture the correct information that we can then take and use it as action, to move forward and take it to the proper election officials,\u201d she explained. \u201cSo we developed an app that would help people \u2013 empower them, really \u2013 when they go and vote to, if they see something, capture it and get the word out. If you see your ballot flipping on a screen, capture it and get the word out.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cWe also are streaming all of that information so that on Election Day \u2013 well, and even now, as reports are already feeding in through VoteStand \u2013 you\u2019ll get a sense of what\u2019s happening where not only locally, but nationally. It\u2019s incredibly important that we have the ability to archive this information so that you have empirical evidence to support the reforms that are so desperately needed,\u201d said Engelbrecht. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have that kind of proof, it\u2019s far too easy to just chalk it up to hearsay. We\u2019re past that.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThe fraud has been institutionalized,\u201d she warned. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest problem that we face. You look at corruption to nuts in this government, and the thought that on Election Day, when we choose the leaders arguably of the free world, they\u2019ll be tempted to exploit the weaknesses.\u201d</span></p>, <p><em>Breitbart News Daily</em> airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m.\xa0to 9:00 a.m.\xa0Eastern.</p>, <p><strong>LISTEN:</strong></p>, <p><iframe frameborder="no" height="400" scrolling="no" src="/web/20161028145336if_/https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F290224364&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;maxwidth=990&amp;maxheight=1000" width="990"></iframe></p>]
