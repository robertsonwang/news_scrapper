She later attempted to remedy her statement by only stating that she regretted saying \u201chalf,\u201d not making clear how many Americans she felt that way about. CNN <a href="/web/20161028153221/http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/09/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-basket-of-deplorables/">reported</a> Trump\u2019s response to Clinton\u2019s comments, \u201cFor the first time in a long while, her true feelings came out, showing bigotry and hatred for millions of Americans.\u201d</p>, <p>Pence continued speaking to the Reno crowd, \u201cIt\u2019s not so much what they\u2019re reporting out there that frustrates you, but it\u2019s what they\u2019re not reporting.\u201d</p>, <p>He referenced veteran journalist Bob Woodward who <a href="/web/20161028153221/http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/10/23/bob-woodward-on-the-clinton-foundation-its-corrupt/">called</a> the Clinton Foundation \u201ccorrupt.\u201d When during an edition of Fox News Sunday, Chris Wallace asked Woodward about a new Wikileaks revelation of a \u201c$12 million deal between Hillary Clinton, the foundation, and the king of Morocco,\u201d Woodward called it not only corrupt, but also \u201ca scandal.\u201d</p>, <p>Pence has been repeating a message of \u201cit\u2019s time to come home\u201d at his recent rallies as he speaks to Republicans. He has made the call after speaking of Trump having won independents and some Democrats. Shortly after the next rally in Salt Lake City, Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz moved to tweet that he would vote for Trump.</p>, <p>Around 400 people attended the rally that was one of three Pence rallies for the Trump-Pence ticket in three separate states on Wednesday. The next stop in Salt Lake City, Utah brought out 2,300 people, 1,000 of which were lined up outside as there was no room left in the venue. The third stop of the day was Colorado Springs, Colorado where for the third time that day a very enthusiastic crowd greeted the vice presidential candidate with signs, cheers and chants for the Trump-Pence ticket.</p>, <p><i>Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter </i><a href="/web/20161028153221/https://twitter.com/MichelleDiana">@MichelleDiana</a><i>\xa0</i></p>]
