[<p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>Now Clinton supporters are citing an unnamed Trump official who actually used the word \u201c<a href="/web/20161028152248/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-27/inside-the-trump-bunker-with-12-days-to-go">suppression</a>\u201d to describe the effect of negative news stories circulated\xa0on social media and aimed at \u201cidealistic white liberals, young women, and African Americans\u201d who might otherwise vote for\xa0the Democratic nominee.</p>, <p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>The truth is that the term \u201csuppression\u201d is not necessarily nefarious. Here is a <a href="/web/20161028152248/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/donald-trump/12147434/Hillary-Clinton-is-fighting-for-her-political-life-in-New-Hampshire.html">report</a> on the New Hampshire primary, about how bad weather could \u201csuppress\u201d Trump\u2019s voters:</p>, <p>Bush is hoping that history will say he took on the forces of populism honestly and angrily and won. If the terrible weather in New Hampshire suppresses the Trump vote then the media spin might be that we\u2019ve seen the real ceiling of The Donald\u2019s support. Don\u2019t be surprised if Trump wins but polls below 30 per cent.</p>, <p>Other kinds of \u201csuppression\u201d are less benign. Both campaigns run active voter suppression campaigns. Clinton allies telling Jewish voters that Trump is Hitler, for example, is classic suppression (and there is evidence that it is working).</p>, <p>There is also \u201creverse suppression.\u201d Telling black voters that voter ID is an attempt to suppress them, for example, is a tactic that President Barack Obama and other Democrats have used to encourage black voters to go to the polls (even though polls suggest\xa0most black voters actually approve of voter ID laws).</p>, <p>And then there is the opposite tactic, which is to scare voters into heading to the polls by telling them that they will face some kind of sanction if they do not vote. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) was <a href="/web/20161028152248/http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/01/31/2907803/">unapologetic</a> about mailers his campaigns used in Iowa that reminded voters their participation in primaries was a matter of public record. Democrats <a href="/web/20161028152248/http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/10/31/bullying-democrats-send-letters-threatening-people-to-vote-or-else/">sent a similar mailer in 2014</a>.</p>, <p>The latest hubbub fits both categories. A Trump official tells a journalist about voter suppression plans; the Clinton-friendly media pretends it is more nefarious than it is.</p>, <p>Welcome to kitchen-sink season.</p>, <p><em>Joel B.
