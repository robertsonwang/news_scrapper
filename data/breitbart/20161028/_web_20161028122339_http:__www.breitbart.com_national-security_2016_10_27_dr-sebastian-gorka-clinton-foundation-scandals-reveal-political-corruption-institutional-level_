[<p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked why Hillary Clinton didn\u2019t shut the controversial Foundation down when she began running for President, Gorka replied, \u201cIt\u2019s simply a case of \u2018the rules don\u2019t apply to us. Let the peasants obey the rules that apply to everybody else. But if you work in the Clinton State Department, if you work for the Clinton Foundation, you\u2019re above all of that.\u2019\u201d</span></p>, <p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThe government email is clunky!\u201d he imagined Clinton complaining about the system she was supposed to be using. \u201cSo who cares if we\u2019re talking about sensitive issues? This isn\u2019t about the national security of America. It\u2019s not about the State Department. It\u2019s about the Clinton corporation. What we have here is, in effect, political corruption at an institutional level.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regan asked how Hillary Clinton\u2019s apparent inability to recognize that her email server was a problem reflected on her \u201cability to lead our country.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cLook, you\u2019re always going to have \u2013 powerful people to a certain extent always have a certain bubble around them, a lot of yes men, a lot of yes women. But this is beyond that,\u201d Gorka replied. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cLet\u2019s just look at one issue. </span><a href="/web/20161028151401/https://www.amazon.com/Clinton-Cash-Foreign-Governments-Businesses/dp/0062369296/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1477590721&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=clinton+cash"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clinton Cash</span></i></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">has given us scores of issues. Let\u2019s look at one issue: Uranium is a strategic national asset. Why? Because you make nuclear bombs out of it. When she was Secretary of State, we now know she had sign off on the sale of twenty percent\xa0of our uranium as a nation, to Russian companies that were linked directly to the Kremlin. She signs off on that. That\u2019s her husband, through the Foundation, is getting $140 million from the same companies. This is money laundering in the political world. This is pay-for-play at the hundreds of millions of dollars level,\u201d he said.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for why the mainstream media\u2019s coverage of such a remarkable scandal has been so limited, Gorka humorously suggested that \u201cevery time they dump 30,000 emails, you have to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">work. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some journalists that don\u2019t want to work too hard.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI think it\u2019s a bit more than lazy journalists,\u201d he added more seriously. \u201cIt is about the Establishment. Except for places like Fox and Breitbart, these people are rooting \u2013 look at the donations from media to Hillary. Ninety\xa0percent of journalists donating to a political campaign donate to the DNC.\u201d</span></p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="557" src="/web/20161028151401if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/yBzfNL63fc4?feature=oembed" width="990"></iframe></p>]
