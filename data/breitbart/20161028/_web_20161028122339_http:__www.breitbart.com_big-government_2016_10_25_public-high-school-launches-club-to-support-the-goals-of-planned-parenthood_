Goddu explained that Generation Action chapters operate by advocating for reproductive rights, keeping Planned Parenthood clinics open, offering a wide range of publicly available education services, and lobbying to remove targeted restrictions such as those imposed on abortion providers. Maggie Walker\u2019s Generation Action club plans to meet the goals of its founders and of the Planned Parenthood organization through three primary branches.</p>, <p>Goddu is completing a mentorship at Planned Parenthood and says she hopes that the Planned Parenthood club can be an extension of her work into school. She is critical of her middle school, where she claims sex education had an emphasis on abstinence from sex.</p>, <p>\u201cThey said that the only definition of abstinence was that it was abstaining from sex until marriage between a man and a woman,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I was like \u2014 abstinence can be applied to many things \u2014 like abstaining from doing basically anything!\u201d</p>, <p>Mier says the school\u2019s new Planned Parenthood club will provide \u201cinclusive sex education that\u2019s not just about\u2026what\u2019s between a man and a woman, but also is LGBTQ inclusive\u2026\u201d</p>, <p>Vickers explains that \u201cchoice\u201d is a primary talking point of the Planned Parenthood club\u2019s education program.</p>, <p>\u201cA choice in any type of good society should be\u2026the choice to abort if she wants to or [the woman] should have the choice to have the child if she wants to and feel like the government places enough value on the life of all people that they will support her and her child in every way possible,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is a choice, and that\u2019s what I want people to know.\u201d</p>, <p>The Jabberwock notes that Vickers views a lack of reproductive justice in the black community as a critical issue for her as well.</p>, <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really about justice for all people and what they need and deserve,\u201d she said.</p>, <p>According to Planned Parenthood, <a href="/web/20161028151003/https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/community/planned-parenthood-generation-action/">Planned Parenthood Generation Action</a> is a network of young community organizers who \u201cmobilize advocates for reproductive freedom\u201d and \u201craise public awareness about reproductive health and rights.\u201d</p>, <p>Planned Parenthood leaders <a href="/web/20161028151003/https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/blog/you-told-us-whats-most-important-you-election-and-we-listened-2/">say</a> that, as they have travelled the country meeting with their political Action Fund leaders during this election year, they discovered that what\u2019s most important to their Generation Action young people is \u201cabortion, sexuality, and sex-positivity.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cFor 2016 and beyond, these leaders\xa0will be\xa0driving the\xa0program that will result in real change for sexual and reproductive health, rights, and freedom,\u201d Planned Parenthood says. \u201cThat will change the nature of power in this country.\u201d</p>, <p>Planned Parenthood is the nation\u2019s largest provider of abortions. The group receives more than a half billion dollars of taxpayer funds each year and performs over 300,000 abortions annually as well.</p>, <p>For over a year, Planned Parenthood has been under congressional investigation stemming from allegations that it illegally sells the body parts of aborted babies for a profit.</p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">We must defund <a href="/web/20161028151003/https://twitter.com/PPact">@PPact</a> <a href="/web/20161028151003/https://twitter.com/hashtag/100yearsofabuse?src=hash">#100yearsofabuse</a> <a href="/web/20161028151003/https://t.co/zg9ng1Vkty">https://t.co/zg9ng1Vkty</a> <a href="/web/20161028151003/https://t.co/QpBEBPaaZ6">pic.twitter.com/QpBEBPaaZ6</a></p>, <p>\u2014 Students for Life (@Students4LifeHQ) <a href="/web/20161028151003/https://twitter.com/Students4LifeHQ/status/787805617553567745">October 17, 2016</a></p>, <p><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="/web/20161028151003js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></p>, <p>\u201cI think Planned Parenthood has been spending too much time trying to copy the Pro-Life Generation with their not-so-subtle messaging of the \u2018Planned Parenthood Generation\u2019 and now their entrance into the realm of high school clubs,\u201d Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, tells Breitbart News. \u201cThey boast 200 college groups while Students for Life of America passed the 1,000 group mark for high school and college pro-life groups earlier this year.\u201d</p>, <p>Hawkins explains Planned Parenthood\u2019s drive to appeal to more young people in the country.</p>, <p>\u201cPlanned Parenthood is desperately seeking new clients so they are relying on their predatory business model of getting young women to trust them for their faulty birth control, and then when they get pregnant, to get abortions at Planned Parenthood,\u201d Hawkins adds. \u201cHigh schoolers are smarter than that and we\u2019ve been educating them for years already about Planned Parenthood\u2019s sleazy business plans.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cHonestly, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but good luck, Planned Parenthood,\u201d Hawkins says. \u201cThis is a pro-life generation, not the Planned Parenthood generation.\u201d</p>, <p>Breitbart News reached out for comment to Maggie Walker but received no immediate response prior to publication.</p>]
