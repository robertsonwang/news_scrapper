[<p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThey fell pretty neatly into three camps,\u201d she said. \u201cThe first camp I\u2019ll call the </span><a href="/web/20161028141701/http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/12/christian-speaker-beth-moore-stands-gap-hillary-clinton/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beth Moore</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> camp, the camp that just are so turned off by the things they\u2019ve seen, the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Access Hollywood </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">tapes, they can\u2019t take it. And often there\u2019s things in their personal lives that they are just so hurt and offended by what they\u2019ve seen that they just can\u2019t go there.\u201d</span></p>, <p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThen there\u2019s the other group. There\u2019s the group that I will call the Burke Mom group,\u201d she continued. \u201cI named this after a Bible study that I was speaking to in Burke, Virginia, in which a home-school mom helpfully suggested that perhaps they should hand out barf bags, and I quote, to people after they vote, so they can go do what they need to do, and then if they feel like they need to throw up, they\u2019re taken care of.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cAnd then, there was the third group, and those are the Die Hards. These are women who could care less. They are not looking for a husband, or they\u2019re not looking for a pastor, and they\u2019re certainly not looking for a friend. They want someone who will swim the Washington moat with a knife in their teeth, and that\u2019s what they see Trump as doing,\u201d Nance concluded. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThe last two groups will be voting for Trump, and they\u2019re sticking by him. And I would say that makes up the majority, I think, of evangelical women, as I\u2019m talking to different people. They may not like him, or they may love him, but they\u2019re gonna stick by him, and they\u2019re gonna vote,\u201d she predicted. \u201cAnd let me just say the first group, the Beth Moore group, are still voting down-ballot, so it gives me hope for these Senate races as things unfold.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nance and SiriusXM host Alex Marlow looked back to previous campaigns in which conservatives held their noses (or, as Ann Coulter humorously suggested in 2008, got drunk) and voted for GOP Establishment candidates with whom they were not entirely happy. For many Republican voters, the flaws in their own candidate paled beside the threat of a Democrat victory.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Likewise, Nance said many women view the 2016 election as a \u201cbinary choice, and rightfully so, and they recognize they really only have two choices, and they don\u2019t want Hillary Clinton.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing the race tighten. You\u2019re seeing people coming back to reality, setting emotion aside and saying, \u2018I don\u2019t like it, but I\u2019m going to hold my nose, and this is how I\u2019m going to vote,\u2019\u201d she said.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cBut I will say there\u2019s something that I\u2019m concerned about,\u201d she told Marlow, \u201cand I want to talk about this more after the election. And that is this division within the Church. We\u2019re seeing Christians \u2013 just last night, I was looking on Facebook on the Liberty page, the way people were coming after each other, it\u2019s just wrong. At the end of the day, there needs to be unity within the body of Christ, as a believer, and we have to give each other room for conscience.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nance said she would not participate in such vicious infighting, granting that Beth Moore has \u201creasons for the way she feels; she\u2019s been through a lot,\u201d and those experiences inform her refusal to support Trump for president.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cAt the same time, I\u2019m voting without emotion here,\u201d Nance said of her own perspective. \u201cI\u2019m voting purely with my head, and I\u2019m voting based on what I know is going to happen. There\u2019s between one and four Supreme Court justices, there\u2019s about five hundred lower court judges, and 5,000 leaders that are governmental appointees who make huge decisions.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She cited transgender bathroom directives and changes to Obamacare employer mandates, as examples of the huge, society-changing decisions made by such appointees. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cMy husband I and were just discussing that. That\u2019s devastating for churches,\u201d she said of the employer mandates. \u201cHow do you have someone running your youth group? Now you can\u2019t afford them. You can\u2019t pay them overtime. There\u2019s serious issues that affect the lives of the church and religious freedoms. You\u2019re forced to bake the cake. Can you practice your faith </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">just </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">inside the walls of the church, or can you live it out in every area of your life? The government is getting between us and our ability to do what we believe, and frankly I think it\u2019s gonna get worse under a Hillary Clinton administration.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marlow brought Ann Coulter into the conversation again, citing her recent column \u201c</span><a href="/web/20161028141701/http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/26/ann-coulter-new-country-women-minorities-hit-hardest/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our New Country \u2013 Women and Minorities Hit Hardest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,\u201d in which she argues that \u201cminorities and women are the ones who stand to suffer the most from another Democratic administration.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nance agreed with Coulter\u2019s point, beginning with \u201cmoral issues\u201d like abortion, which \u201cnot only ends the life of the baby, but it harms the soul, and sometimes the body, of the mother. There\u2019s one dead and one wounded, walking away.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cBut I also can talk about just the pocketbook issues,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe have seen the devastation \u2013 there has not been the recovery that there should have been. The African American community has suffered so much under this. Minorities have certainly suffered.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cEven at CWA\u2019s budget, these new directives blow our budget, and so we have to think it through, whether or not I can keep all of my employees,\u201d she elaborated. \u201cWe\u2019re a non-profit organization, we have to live within our means, within the money that our donors give us. Businesses have to do the same. And so it\u2019s often that lower-level employee that has to go, and now doesn\u2019t have a job.\u201d </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cWe want to herd everyone on to Medicaid and onto the welfare rolls, food stamps? Is that really the answer?\u201d Nance asked. \u201cNo, a job is the answer. Work is meaningful. It is redemptive. And what is important is we grow the economy, and we uncuff the ability for the free market to roar back to life and to be able to innovate. We reduce regulations so there can be new entrances to the market.\u201d </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cAnd honestly, when we talk about the system being rigged, there\u2019s this collusion I believe between big companies that can afford all the lawyers, and can jump through all the hoops of regulation in order to make money, and in order to be able to thrive \u2013 and then there\u2019s the little guy who can\u2019t afford to do that, so can never compete, can never get into the market,\u201d she added. \u201cAll of this, and there\u2019s other things we could talk about, at the end of the day, keep us stuck, and keep people from being able to grow their businesses and offer new jobs, and give their employees better salaries, and be able to do better.\u201d</span></p>, <p><em>Breitbart News Daily</em> airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m.\xa0to 9:00 a.m.\xa0Eastern.</p>, <p><strong>LISTEN:</strong></p>, <p><iframe frameborder="no" height="400" scrolling="no" src="/web/20161028141701if_/https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F290224754&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;maxwidth=990&amp;maxheight=1000" width="990"></iframe></p>]
