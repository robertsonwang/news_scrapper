[<p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>The Clinton campaign is finally responding to queries from reporters about the content of John Podesta\u2019s now public campaign emails released by Wikileaks, after weeks of questioning\xa0their authenticity.</p>, <p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>Since Wikileaks started releasing Podesta\u2019s emails in early October, the Clinton campaign has repeatedly refused to comment, saying the emails were \u201cstolen\u201d and that campaign officials had no way of knowing whether they were authentic.</p>, <p>But after <a href="/web/20161028151150/http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/27/politics/clinton-hack-wikileaks-collateral-damage/index.html">CNN</a> questioned the campaign about emails referring to Hillary Clinton\u2019s <a href="/web/20161028151150/https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/27111">\u201chead\u201d </a>and <a href="/web/20161028151150/http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/24/head-space-hillary-clintons-inner-circle-tiptoes-around-health-issues/">\u201cheadspace,\u201d</a> the campaign responded.</p>, <p>\u201cThey are clearly about her frame of mind or her mood,\u201d an unidentified Clinton campaign source replied.</p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">\u201cThey are clearly about her frame of mind or her mood\u201d <a href="/web/20161028151150/https://t.co/CO7uFAopCb">pic.twitter.com/CO7uFAopCb</a></p>, <p>\u2014 Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) <a href="/web/20161028151150/https://twitter.com/charliespiering/status/791621648973570049">October 27, 2016</a></p>, <p><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="/web/20161028151150js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></p>, <p>That marks a major milestone for the campaign, suggesting that it realizes the Wikileaks emails are having an effect when left unchallenged.</p>, <p>For example, when Jennifer Palmieri and John Podesta where asked about anti-Catholic comments made in the emails, they both replied, \u201cI\u2019m a Catholic, I don\u2019t recognize that email that we saw.\u201d</p>, <p>When asked to comment on the emails on October 9, Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine wouldn\u2019t even confirm the validity of the emails.</p>, <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we can dignify documents dumped by WikiLeaks and just assume that they\u2019re all accurate and true,\u201d he said. \u201cAnybody who hacks in to get documents is completely capable of manipulating them.\u201d</p>, <p>Now, it appears, the Clinton campaign is admitting that at least some of the emails are real, as it appears willing to \u201cdignify\u201d them with clarification.</p>]
