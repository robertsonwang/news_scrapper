[<p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>Chapman observed that \u201cit\u2019s not exactly safe to entrust your copy of the Constitution to Hillary Clinton,\u201d and that choosing to do so might mean we get that Constitution back with \u201csome parts missing or mutilated \u2014 like the First Amendment and the Second.\u201d</p>, <p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>According to\xa0<a href="/web/20161029120214/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/chapman/ct-hillary-clinton-first-second-amendent-guns-chapman-perspec-1023-jm-20161021-column.html">Chapman</a>, Clinton\u2019s policies are more anti-gun than those we have seen under President Obama. For example, Obama\u2019s gun control push has been coupled with an admission that \u201cthe Second Amendment protects the right of individuals to bear arms.\u201d Whether Obama\u2019s belief in an individual right is heartfelt is another question altogether, but at least he said he believes in a constitutionally protected individual right. On June 5,\xa0<a href="/web/20161029120214/http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/06/05/hillary-clinton-wont-admit-right-bear-arms-constitutional/">Clinton twice refused</a> to affirm whether a constitutionally protected individual right exists. Therefore, Chapman\xa0observes, \u201cWhen it comes to gun rights, Clinton has taken a position appreciably to the left of Barack Obama\u2019s.\u201d</p>, <p>But the problem is not simply her June 5 refusal to admit the constitutionality of the right to keep and bear arms; it is also the clear contradiction that emerged during the last presidential debate, wherein she maintained her opposition to the <em>District of Columbia v Heller</em> (2008) ruling while simultaneously attempting to espouse her new conviction that \u201cthere\u2019s an individual right to bear arms.\u201d</p>, <p>Thus, she opposes the <em>Heller</em> decision, which reaffirmed the existence of an individual right to keep and bear arms, yet says she believes \u201cthere\u2019s an individual right to bear arms.\u201d Chapman\xa0covered the contradiction this way:</p>, <p>So Clinton rejects the Supreme Court decision that established constitutional protection for that right \u2014 but now agrees the right has constitutional protection? As former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan once said, \u201cIf I seem unduly clear to you, you must have misunderstood what I said.\u201d</p>, <p>Chapman continued:</p>, <p>She and Obama both favor universal background checks for gun purchases, a ban on \u201cassault weapons\u201d and denial of guns to anyone on the federal no-fly list. But her cramped view of the Second Amendment suggests she would favor additional curbs that she knows the Supreme Court would not abide.</p>, <p>Her solution to this impasse with the Supreme Court? Change the makeup of the court with \u201ca new justice or two.\u201d At the same time, she wants to strike back at the protections of the First Amendment handed down by the court in <em>Citizens United</em> (2010). \u201cShe proposes a constitutional amendment to overturn the decision \u2014 which would be the first time in our history that the Bill of Rights would be altered to restrict our freedoms.\u201d</p>, <p><em>AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of \u201c<a class=" x5l x5l x5l x5l" href="/web/20161029120214/http://www.podcastone.com/bullets-with-awr-hawkins" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bullets with AWR Hawkins</a>,\u201d a Breitbart News podcast.
