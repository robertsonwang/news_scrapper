The Venezuelan Constitution allows for such a recall measure, led by the opposition in the National Assembly. The electoral commission alleged that the opposition\u2019s signatures were invalid, though it did not provide any evidence for such a measure.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text">RONALDO SCHEMIDT/AFP/Getty Images</p>, <p>In response, the National Assembly declared that Maduro, by violating the constitution to perpetuate himself in power, had <a href="/web/20161028152523/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/10/24/venezuela-national-assembly-declares-president-staged-coup/">staged a coup</a>. The coup declaration from the nation\u2019s legislature prohibits the armed forces from obeying Maduro.

Maduro met with Pope Francis on Monday, who has announced that he will mediate talks between the two sides. It is unclear what the two sides would discuss in such a talk, and Capriles and other opposition leaders have insisted that talks are impossible under Maduro abides by the nation\u2019s constitution. National Assembly Leader Jes\xfas Torrealba did meet with a senior Vatican envoy on Monday, however.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text">JUAN BARRETO/AFP/Getty Images</p>]
