We use our games to bring people together, to build trust and to strengthen our communities. As we move from symbolic gestures to action, we will continue to leverage our platform to positively impact our community.\u201d</p>, <p>The statement refers to the anthem protests as \u201cgestures,\u201d <a href="/web/20161221065621/http://www.breitbart.com/sports/2016/10/26/et-tu-melo-carmelo-anthony-takes-shot-colin-kaepernicks-protest-gestures/">exactly the term Carmelo Anthony used</a> to describe Colin Kaepernick\u2019s empty and ineffectual efforts.</p>, <p>The team conscripted one of their dancers to sing the anthem instead. In the game that followed, the Oklahoma City Thunder crashed Joel Embiid\u2019s long delayed debutante ball. Despite the 2014 first-round pick scoring 20 points and grabbing seven boards, the Thunder emerged with a 103-97 win.</p>, <p>NBA players approved of a rule in their collective bargaining agreement that says they must stand for the playing of national anthems, both American and Canadian. Singers clearly do not. Denasia Lawrence had given no outward indication that she planned to protest when <a href="/web/20161221065621/http://www.breitbart.com/sports/2016/10/22/team-employee-kneels-while-singing-anthem-before-heat-76ers-game/">she sung the anthem prior to an NBA game</a> in Miami. Just before she started to sing she opened up her jacket, revealing a \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d shirt, and then knelt down to sing the song. Lawrence claimed that she protested racial oppression.</p>, <p>Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: <a href="/web/20161221065621/https://twitter.com/themightygwinn?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">@themightygwinn</a></p>]
