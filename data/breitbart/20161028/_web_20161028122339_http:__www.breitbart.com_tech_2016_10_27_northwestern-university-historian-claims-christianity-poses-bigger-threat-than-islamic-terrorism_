[<p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>Catherine M. Wallace, who is a faculty member at Northwestern\u2019s School of Medicine and a Christian herself, <a href="/web/20161028152941/https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2016/10/21/co-op-scholar-says-christian-fundamentalism-danger/">argues</a> that fundamentalist access to United States\xa0armaments is the number one threat to the nation\u2019s security.</p>, <p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>Wallace argues that because radical Christians are in positions of power and control the nuclear codes, they pose a greater danger to American society than do Islamic terrorists.</p>, <p>\u201cIf [anything Islamic] wanted to attack an American city, they had to hijack an airliner. If they want to blow up a concert, they need to put bombs on their own children and send young men in to kill themselves\u2026 that kind of radicalism [Christian fundamentalism] in control of nuclear codes was a much, much greater threat,\u201d Wallace claimed.</p>, <p>According to\xa0<em>The Chicago Maroon</em>, the student newspaper of the University of Chicago, Wallace believes that a literal reading of the Bible is responsible for the threats posed by Christian fundamentalists.</p>, <p>In Wallace\u2019s view, this radicalism stems from a literal reading of the Bible. \u201cNobody in the ancient world would have read the Bible literally,\u201d Wallace said. The idea of a literal reading is a thoroughly modern phenomenon,\xa0according to Wallace\u2014church fathers of the past would discourage anyone from taking the Bible literally.</p>, <p>Therefore, according to Wallace, the fundamentalists have it all wrong. \u201cChristian fundamentalism is a malignant form of Christianity,\u201d Wallace said. In her opinion, their literalist reading creates misconceptions of what the Bible means, fostering a climate of hate and leading to increased and unnecessary conflict between Christians and the rest of the world. \u2026</p>, <p>When asked a final question on how she thought Jesus would respond to the modern political climate, Wallace answered on a positive note. \u201cJesus was first a Jewish prophet reciting the Jewish rant in its standard edition, which is social justice, socio-economic justice. Care for widows and orphans, which is to say the unemployable. People who can\u2019t earn their own living. And the just sharing of the world\u2019s resources.\u201d</p>, <p>Wallace concluded the conversation on the dangers of Christian fundamentalism by arguing that a modern Jesus Christ would be a socialist and advocate for \u201cthe just sharing of the world\u2019s resources.\u201d</p>, <p><em><em>Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about Free Speech and Intellectual Diversity for Breitbart.
