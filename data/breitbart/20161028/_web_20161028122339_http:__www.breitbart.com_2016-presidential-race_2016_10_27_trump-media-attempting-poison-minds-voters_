[<p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>Thursday on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump accused the media of attempting to \u201cpoison\u201d the mind of the American voter.</p>, <p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>Trump said, \u201cI could just speak for myself that I don\u2019t want to mention a specific act, but so often they\u2019ll say, \u2018Oh, Donald Trump said this or he said that, and what I said was fine. If a Democrat had said it, if Hillary had said it, they wouldn\u2019t have even thought about it, but I\u2019ll say something that\u2019s perfect and next day it\u2019s headlines. Donald Trump said this or that.\u201d</p>, <p>He continued, \u201cI went to an Ivy League school. I was a good student. I\u2019m a very smart person. I know what I\u2019m saying. Sometimes I\u2019ll say something absolutely perfect and I\u2019ll get a call after an interview, like with you, \u2018did you say this or that?\u2019 And they\u2019ll skew it so unfairly.\u201d</p>, <p>He added, \u201cThey don\u2019t really, because what happens\u2014you poison their minds\u2014you really do. The media poisons the mind of the American voter. They do. It\u2019s unfair, but the thing is, the American voter is really smart. I mean I\u2019m going to see how smart they are, but the American voter, I think the American voter is smarter than the media.\u201d</p>, <p><em>Follow Pam Key on Twitter <a href="/web/20161029115959/https://twitter.com/pamkeyNEN">@pamkeyNEN</a></em></p>]
