[<p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>For months now, we\u2019ve been told that Hillary Clinton\u2019s 33,000 missing emails were permanently erased and destroyed beyond recovery. But newly released FBI notes strongly suggest they still exist in several locations \u2014 and they could be recovered, if only someone would impanel a grand jury and seize them.</p>, <p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p><span class="s1">The emails were created during Clinton\u2019s use of a home-built and largely unprotected email system for her personal and government emails, and also for her management of the scandal-wracked, <a href="/web/20161028132616/http://www.breitbart.com/tag/clinton-foundation/" target="_blank">foreign-funded foundation</a> while she was working as Secretary of State. </span></p>, <p><span class="s1">Clinton insists she\u2019s handed over all of the government</span><span class="s1">\xa0emails \u2014 which actually belong to the taxpayer \u2014 and insists she didn\u2019t break the law by mixing personal and government business or by storing and swapping classified information on her own email network. The hidden 33,000 emails are just emails about her personal life, she says.\xa0</span></p>, <p><span class="s1">Top\xa0<a href="/web/20161028132616/http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/26/wikileaks-top-democrat-strategist-warned-podesta-hillary-seems-indifferent-to-systemic-corruption/" target="_blank">Democrats have quietly slammed Clinton</a> for her recklessness and ethical short-cuts, but the\xa0</span><span class="s1">FBI <a href="/web/20161028132616/http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/07/05/james-comey-admits-hillary-might-have-committed-crime-but-wont-recommend-prosecution/" target="_blank">leadership decided</a> that she should not be charged with crimes in the run-up to the 2016 election. </span></p>, <p><span class="s1">Since that decision was announced, there\u2019s been <a href="/web/20161028132616/http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/24/wsj-terry-mcauliffe-fbi-jill-mccabe-clinton-emails/" target="_blank">growing evidence</a> that the FBI and the Department of Justice handcuffed the <a href="/web/20161028132616/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/10/14/fbi-agents-furious-top-brass-letting-clinton-off-hook/" target="_blank">FBI investigators</a> and granted favorable treatment to Clinton\u2019s staff. </span></p>, <p><span class="s1">Now Sperry shows how Justice Department and FBI officials have also declined multiple opportunities to find copies of the missing 33,000 emails that would provide more evidence about whether Clinton was obeying or violating many federal laws:</span></p>, <p>In a May interview with FBI agents, an executive with the Denver contractor that maintained Clinton\u2019s private server revealed that an underling didn\u2019t bleach-clean all her subpoenaed emails, just ones he stored in a data file he used to transfer the emails from the server to Clinton\u2019s aides, who in turn sorted them for delivery to Congress.</p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Platte River Networks executive, whose name was redacted from the interview report, said PRN tech Paul Combetta \u201ccreated a \u2018vehicle\u2019 to transfer email files from the live mailboxes of [Clinton Executive Services Corp.] email accounts [and] then later used BleachBit software to shred the \u2018vehicle,\u2019 but the email content still existed in the live email accounts.\u201d</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unless one of Clinton\u2019s aides had the capability to log in to the PRN server as an administrator and remove a mailbox, her archived mailboxes more than likely still reside somewhere in that system. And they may also materialize on an internal \u201cshared drive\u201d that PRN created to control access to the Clinton email accounts among PRN employees. PRN has been under FBI order to preserve all emails and other evidence since the start of its investigation last year.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Clinton\u2019s missing \u201cpersonal\u201d emails may also be captured on a Google server. According to FBI notes, Combetta \u201ctransferred all of the Clinton email content to a personal Google email address he created.\u201d Only the FBI never subpoenaed Google to find out.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">The FBI documents also reveal that Hillary\u2019s server was mirrored on a cloud server in Pennsylvania maintained by Datto Inc., a tech firm that performs cloud-to-cloud data protection.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">When PRN contracted with Datto, it requested that Hillary\u2019s server be backed up locally and privately. But the techs forgot to order the private node, and they sent the server backup data \u201cremotely to Datto\u2019s secure cloud and not to a local private node.\u201d The FBI never subpoenaed Datto\u2019s server, either.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Read it all <a href="/web/20161028132616/http://nypost.com/2016/10/25/hillarys-33000-emails-might-not-be-missing-after-all/" target="_blank">here</a>.\xa0</span></p>]
