Two hours later, at 9:18pm, a more intense and lasting quake hit, registering 5.9. The final temblor was recorded at 11:42pm with a magnitude of 4.6, according to the National Institute of Geophysics surveys.</p>, <p>The epicenters of the three quakes were all in the same vicinity, not 15\xa0miles from the devastating earthquake that struck the medieval town of Norcia in August.</p>, <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to speak of an aftershock,\u201d said Spuri. \u201cIt\u2019s a second earthquake: the area that had already been put to the test is now in a situation of extreme gravity.\u201d</p>, <p>The only difference between the two quakes, Spuri added, is that for the moment there have been no <a href="/web/20161028152836/http://www.lastampa.it/2016/10/27/italia/cronache/notte-di-paura-in-centro-italia-dopo-le-forti-scosse-di-terremoto-notte-in-strada-sotto-la-pioggia-XCC6WwFTvFp8nfZk5w2vcM/pagina.html">deaths</a>, aside from a 73-year-old man who died from a heart attack after the first quake struck.</p>, <p>But in the town of Camerino alone, some 700 people are temporarily without homes, and spent the night in two makeshift camps set up for the emergency. Meanwhile, dozens of people have been hospitalized for shock or other injuries.</p>, <p>The hardest hit cities and towns include Visso, Ussita, Castelsantangelo sul Nera, Muccia, Pieve Torina, San Gines, Camerino, Caldarola, in short, all the areas surrounding the quakes\u2019 epicentral area.</p>, <p>\u201cMy engineers tell me that the old town is under such conditions that it might all be unusable,\u201d said the mayor of Visso, Giuliano Pazzaglini. \u201cWe had no casualties and only three minor injuries, but the damage to the buildings are very serious. Many have lost part of their fa\xe7ade and a church collapsed in Borgo Sant\u2019Antonio.</p>, <p>According to the mayor of Ussita, Giuliano Rinaldi, \u201ca number of houses have collapsed and our town is finished.\u201d</p>, <p><em>Follow Thomas D.
