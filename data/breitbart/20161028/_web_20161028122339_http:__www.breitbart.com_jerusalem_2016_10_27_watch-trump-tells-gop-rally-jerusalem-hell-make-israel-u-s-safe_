She is hated by too many progressives, because she is successful and her people are free,\u201d he said.</p>, <p>Pence also said Israel\u2019s military defends the Jewish state with \u201cdecency, humanity and restraint.\u201d</p>, <p>Trump\u2019s adviser on Israel affairs, David Friedman, came to Israel for the event.

Her choices \u201cwill be destructive to American freedoms and the American way of life.\u201d</p>, <p>Marks admitted that while he was not completely \u201cenamored\u201d by Trump, he likes that \u201che\u2019s not part of the big boys\u2019 club.\u201d Clinton, Marks said, was \u201cunder the thumb of the New World Order\u201d and as such he\u2019s \u201cvery, very scared of her.\u201d</p>, <p>Marks added that, most crucially, Trump will fulfill his campaign pledge to relocate the American embassy to Jerusalem.</p>, <p>\u201cThey all promise it, but he will actually do it.
