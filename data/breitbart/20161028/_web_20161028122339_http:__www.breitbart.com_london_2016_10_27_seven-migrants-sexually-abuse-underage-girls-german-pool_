The group swam behind their victims in the pool and then surrounded them while in the water, groping and touching the underage girls in a sexual manner.</p>, <p>The father of three\xa0of the victims explained to German media that his daughters had reported to him and the police that the migrant youths had groped and grabbed her and her sisters\u2019 buttocks and breasts. His daughters, aged nine, 11, and 14, were at the swimming pool with a friend of the eldest daughter who was celebrating her birthday.</p>, <p>After breaking free from the young migrants, the 11-year-old girl was able to inform the lifeguards at the pool. The pool staff immediately called the police who arrived on the scene a\xa0short time later.</p>, <p>After being taken into custody by the police, the boys were questioned and then released into the care of their parents.
