[<p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>Cyrus, 23, who has recently been stumping for Clinton in Washington, D.C. and at <a href="/web/20161028152455/http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2016/10/20/miley-cyrus-to-knock-on-doors-in-virginia-for-hillary-clinton-campaign/">George Mason University</a> in Virginia, <a href="/web/20161028152455/http://www.ellentv.com/videos/0-xlpn8gdq/">said</a> about her appearance at the school:</p>, <p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>You listen to so many people, especially when you\u2019re watching the debates, specifically Trump, say so many dumb things, and these young kids were so smart and so amazing to talk to them, not why we should just be terrified of the other option \u2013 it wasn\u2019t about what a horrible guy Trump is \u2013 nasty guy Trump is. It was really about what a great woman she is. And we would choose her no matter what it would be, who she was up against.</p>, <p>So, I really think it was incredible to hear the young people say why they\u2019re voting for her.</p>, <p>\u201cThere will be more people voting in this election than in any election before,\u201d DeGeneres said.</p>, <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we really, really hope,\u201d Cyrus added.</p>, <p>\u201cWe need everyone to register,\u201d pleaded DeGeneres. \u201cWe need everyone to go out.\u201d</p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="324" src="/web/20161028152455if_/http://widgets.ellentube.com/videos/0_xlpn8gdq/" width="575"></iframe></p>, <p>Cyrus said she actively stumped for Clinton because she had openly supported Bernie Sanders in the primary, and wanted to speak to those people who are now undecided about voting for Clinton.</p>, <p>\u201cWhich I find ridiculous,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause in life we don\u2019t always get the choices that we want. We don\u2019t always get what we want, and so you do with what you have.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cAnd these are your choices, and it\u2019s terrifying if someone besides Hillary Clinton \u2013 we shouldn\u2019t even say the name \u2013 becomes president,\u201d Cyrus added. \u201cSo I think she\u2019s a total goddess, and I just love her. And I\u2019m really excited to see her for the next four \u2013 maybe eight \u2013 years.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re right,\u201d DeGeneres responded, expressing concern that many Sanders supporters are still not committing to vote for Clinton.</p>, <p>Cyrus said she saw Sanders supporters protesting when she visited Washington, D.C., and emphasized that she backed him originally because, unlike Clinton, he has always been an LGBT supporter.</p>, <p>\u201cI think, like Hillary \u2013 I think she\u2019s grown, and that\u2019s what it is,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe should celebrate progress and not perfection.\u201d</p>]
