Her interview with former House speaker and current Trump ally Newt Gingrich offered a rarely seen mic-drop. They sparred, mesmerizingly, over the allegations of Trump\u2019s sexual misconduct.</p>, <p>Gingrich tried to dismiss the topic \u2014 and dis the interviewer: \u201cYou are fascinated with sex, and you don\u2019t care about public policy.\u201d</p>, <p>Quite a claim \u2014 and Kelly wasn\u2019t having it. Gingrich had conflated the violence of sexual assault with consensual sex. She fired back, citing polls that show that most women actually do care about the issue of sexual harassment. And, as Gingrich proceeded to repeatedly label former president Bill Clinton a \u201cpredator,\u201d she asserted the obvious: Fox has given plenty of coverage to Clinton\u2019s checkered past with women. (And let\u2019s not forget that while the House speaker was championing Clinton\u2019s impeachment, he was carrying on an adulterous affair with one of his staffers.)</p>, <p>\u2026</p>, <p>Kelly is tough, talented and smart. She did the right thing when she told internal investigators that she, too, had been sexually harassed by her former boss Roger Ailes \u2014 a move that might have been the final blow for him at Fox, where he was fired in August.</p>, <p>She is also often occupied with burnishing her brand and enhancing her career, which includes the matter of the expiration of her Fox contract in 2017. Meanwhile, her autobiographical book, \u201cSettle for More,\u201d comes out next month and is expected to detail her feud with Trump and the toll it took.</p>, <p><em>Read the rest <a href="/web/20161028152530/https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/megyn-kellys-killer-moment-with-gingrich-was-a-welcome-return-to-badassery/2016/10/26/32ef1450-9b8c-11e6-a0ed-ab0774c1eaa5_story.html">here</a>. </em></p>]
