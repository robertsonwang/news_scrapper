[<p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>Breitbart Editor-in-Chief and SiriusXM host Alex Marlow\xa0described the report as exposing the Justice Department of \u201cquite literally extorting companies to fund left-wing activists.\u201d</p>, <p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>\u201cWhen I first joined Breitbart,\u201d Schweizer recalled, \u201cThere was a scandal called Pigford where the federal government was basically taking taxpayer money and giving it to people who were claiming to be victims who were not victims and giving them billions of dollars. This is in that tradition.\u201d</p>, <p>He explained:</p>, <p>What\u2019s really happening here is simple. You\u2019ve got large financial institutions on Wall Street, you\u2019ve got banks like Bank of America, who have in some cases committed financial crimes. I think some of them are real, some of them may not be, but set that aside for a minute. The Department of Justice has gone after them and basically said, \u2018You committed these offenses, you\u2019ve got to pay restitution in the form of billions of dollars.\u2019 Okay, they committed the crime, they ought to pay that.</p>, <p>Now, ostensibly that money, those billions of dollars, are supposed to go to the victims of their financial crimes. If your Wall Street broker committed fraud, you\u2019re supposed to be made whole with this money, and the rest of it is supposed to go to taxpayers.</p>, <p>The problem is the Obama Justice Department has been diverting literally more than $650 million to left-wing groups. They do it under the guise of, \u201cWell, you know, if this bank discriminated against lenders racially, we\u2019re going to give this money to these left-wing quote-unquote housing groups to help deal with the problem.\u201d</p>, <p>But that\u2019s\xa0<em>not\xa0</em>what\u2019s going on. These housing groups are advocacy groups. They\u2019re left-wing organizations. They are registering voters and getting voters out to the voting booth. And they specifically target what they call quote-unquote progressive voters.</p>, <p>So this is taking the Department of Justice, which we\u2019ve experienced so much in recent years has been politicized by this Administration, even further to where now the Department of Justice is transferring money to left-wing groups \u2014 in an effort, frankly I think, to influence this election.</p>, <p><em>Breitbart News Daily</em> airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m.\xa0to 9:00 a.m.\xa0Eastern.</p>, <p><strong>LISTEN:</strong></p>, <p><iframe frameborder="no" height="400" scrolling="no" src="/web/20161028152746if_/https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F290044447&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;maxwidth=990&amp;maxheight=1000" width="990"></iframe></p>]
