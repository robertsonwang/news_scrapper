This is consistent with past practice; historically, matters pertaining to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (C.F.I.U.S.) do not rise to the Secretary\u2019s level. Rather, it is the Assistant Secretary of State for Economic, Energy and Business Affairs who serves as the State Department\u2019s principal representative to C.F.I.U.S. The individual who held that post in 2010 was Jose Fernandez, and he has personally attested that then-Secretary Clinton never interfered with him, saying \u201cMrs. Clinton never intervened with me on any C.F.I.U.S. matter.\u201d</p>, <p>The coordination between Fernandez, the Clinton campaign, and its chairman John Podesta is undeniable.</p>, <p>Sure Fernandez, as Fallon wrote, \u201cpersonally attested\u201d that Clinton \u201cnever interfered\u201d with his decision to sign off on the uranium deal. But he made that claim after professing his commitment to do everything in his power to \u201csupport Secretary Clinton.\u201d</p>, <p>What\u2019s also undeniable is that while\xa0Clinton\u2019s State Department was one of eight agencies to review and sign off on the uranium deal \u2014 then-Secretary of State Clinton herself was the only agency head whose family foundation received\xa0$145 million in donations from multiple people connected to the sale, as reported by the\xa0<i><a class=" x5l" href="/web/20161028152932/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/us/cash-flowed-to-clinton-foundation-as-russians-pressed-for-control-of-uranium-company.html?_r=1" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="This external link will open in a new window">New York Times</a>.</i></p>, <p>Not to mention\xa0Bill Clinton, who received a $500,000 speaking fee for a speech in Moscow paid for by a Russian government-connected bank.</p>, <p>\u201cAnd, in one case, a Russian investment bank connected to the deals paid money to Bill Clinton personally, through a half-million-dollar speaker\u2019s fee,\u201d reports the\xa0<i><a class=" x5l" href="/web/20161028152932/http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/five-questions-about-the-clintons-and-a-uranium-company" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="This external link will open in a new window">New Yorker</a>.</i></p>, <p>To date, no one in the Clinton campaign has ever denied the fact the Clinton-brokered sale\xa0of 20% of U.S. uranium to the Russian government ended up\xa0benefitting people who donated millions to her family foundation.</p>, <p><em>Follow\xa0<a class=" x5l" href="/web/20161028152932/https://twitter.com/jeromeehudson" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jerome Hudson</a>\xa0on Twitter\xa0<a class=" x5l" href="/web/20161028152932/https://twitter.com/jeromeehudson" rel="noopener" target="_blank">@jeromeehudson</a></em></p>]
