[<p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>Snap Inc., the Venice, California parent of Snapchat, has hired the top-tech investment banker team of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to lead its initial public offering.</p>, <p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>In an early demonstration of the heavy demand for the shares, the Wall Street new offering selling group includes JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Deutsche Bank AG, Allen &amp; Co., Barclays Plc and Credit Suisse Group AG.</p>, <p>Although the company\u2019s annual revenue is less than $1 billion, it is believed that Snapchat\u2019s U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission registration statement will value the company at between $25 billion to $35 billion. Although the company\u2019s last private equity funding valued Snap at $18 billion, Bloomberg suggests the company may be able to raise up to $4 billion in cash at a valuation of $40 billion.</p>, <p>The four-year-old messaging service is stomping all social media competition, with a 27 percent daily user growth rate. Many brokerage analysts are blaming Twitter\u2019s stock value\xa0being\xa0cut in half from June 30, 2015 to June 30, 2016, to Snapchat passing <a href="/web/20161028152236/http://quotes.wsj.com/TWTR">Twitter\u2019s daily user count</a> by 15 million. With its market share continuing to erode against Snapchat, <a href="/web/20161028152236/http://fortune.com/2016/09/23/twitter-sale-turnaround/">Twitter has failed</a>\xa0thus far in its recently announced effort to find a deep-pocket merger partner.</p>, <p>Snapchat has made social media communicating more of a game by encouraging millennials to send annotated selfies and short videos. Its imaging\xa0software allows users to swap faces in a photo, transform themselves into puppies, and vomit rainbows. The company encourages users to log in frequently with features such as the\xa0\u201cSnapstreak,\u201d which displays the number of consecutive days they sent messages to their closest friends.</p>, <p>Snapchat\u2019s strongest draw for investors is its dominance in the 12-to-34-year user old age group, which values its short-lived messages that permanently disappear in 24 hours or after viewing. A third of Snapchat\u2019s U.S. user base is between 18 and 24 years-old, and 27 percent of users are between 25 and 34. Snapchat\u2019s fastest growing demographic is the under 12-year-olds, which is growing at the stunning rate of 43 percent this year.</p>, <p>Advertisers crave access to these youth demographics, because they generally do not have strong loyalty to traditional social networks. Snapchat is seen by marketers as engaging in more intimate one-to-one or one-to-few communications, versus Facebook\u2019s broadcast-style sharing across an entire network.</p>, <p>Snapchat\u2019s latest innovation is its just released video-streaming \u201cSpectacles\u201d sunglasses that CEO Evan Spiegel calls a potentially <a href="/web/20161028152236/http://www.breitbart.com/california/2016/09/27/snapchat-releases-spectacles-daily-use-passes-twitter/">disruptive</a> way for the company to become even more deeply\xa0entrenched in its youth demographic.</p>, <p>\u201cSpectacles\u201d were initially panned, with lots of nasty\xa0<a href="/web/20161028152236/http://www.wsj.com/articles/snapchat-releases-first-hardware-product-spectacles-1474682719?mod=djemalertNEWS#livefyre-comment">comments</a>\xa0after a review by the\xa0<em>Wall Street Journal</em>\xa0blog.
