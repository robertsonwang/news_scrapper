[<p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>\u201cThe people of Israel, who from Egypt, where they were enslaved, walked through the desert for forty years until they reached the land promised by God,\u201d he said in his address about migration.</p>, <p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>His address came before giving an <a href="/web/20161028130611/http://www.breakingisraelnews.com/77605/pope-francis-god-promised-holy-land-jews/#IwdietOEmtefzZ5D.97">audience </a>to Arab-Israeli Deputy Minister for Regional Cooperation Ayoub Kara in which he thanked him for his efforts on behalf of Christians in Israel.</p>, <p>According to Kara, the Pope was sending a direct message to UNESCO, whose World Heritage Committee approved a resolution hours before that ignored Jewish and Christian ties to the Temple Mount.</p>, <p>Kara thanked Pope Francis for acknowledging Israel\u2019s rights to the Holy Land and added that there is no question that the resolution harms Christians because it \u201cdistorts historical and theological facts.\u201d</p>, <p>On Thursday, Kara is slated to meet with Vatican Secretary of State Pietro Cardinal Parolin.</p>, <p>Knesset Speaker Yuli Edelstein wrote a letter to Cardinal Parolin in which he urged the pontiff to \u201cuse its best offices to prevent the recurrence of developments of this sort.\u201d</p>, <p>The UNESCO resolution, Edelstein wrote, \u201cis an assault on history and is deeply offensive to both Christianity and Judaism. The denial of the historicity of the two Jerusalem Temples and the Temple Mount as recounted in both the Old and New Testaments is a terrible indictment of the international community when repeatedly adopted by an important UN body.</p>, <p>\u201cThe outrageous repudiation of the millennia-old bond between Judaism and its holiest shrines in Jerusalem is a blatant attempt to rewrite history,\u201d he added. \u201cThe annals of both our religions cannot be erased by raised hands and counted votes.\u201d</p>, <p>Edelstein said that a new resolution is needed to reaffirm Israel\u2019s capital as holy for the three major monotheistic religions, \u201ca city where the two Temples stood and from which the Word of God was first promulgated to humanity by our prophets.\u201d</p>, <p>Education Minister Naftali Bennett slammed the resolution as being \u201ca denial of history, and history will erase the embarrassing decision.\u201d</p>, <p>He added that Israel would suspend any cooperation with UNESCO.</p>, <p>Jewish Home chairwoman Shuli Moalem-Refaeli slammed Arabs in Israel and elsewhere for their \u201cglorious record of harming Jewish, Christian and Muslim holy sites.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cThey also have an impressive record of rewriting history in a way that shames international institutions,\u201d she added.</p>, <p>\u201cIf we were never here and Jesus was a Palestinian, then I suggest that UNESCO condemn the Palestinians for crucifying Jesus,\u201d Moalem-Refaeli said.</p>]
