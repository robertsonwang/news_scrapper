[<p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>\u201cReal change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare. It\u2019s just been announced that Americans are going to experience another massive double-digit hike in Obamacare \u2014 you see that? \u2014 including premiums like, in the great state of Arizona, where they\u2019re going to go up at 116%.</p>, <p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll be there very soon \u2014 unless I win, in which case you not going to\xa0have to worry about it,\u201d he said, as the crowd roared its approval.</p>, <p>\u201cRepealing Obamacare is one of the single most important reasons we must win on November 8,\u201d he added, to more cheers.</p>, <p>He also promised to win the Buckeye State, drawing applause by citing Wednesday\u2019s new poll from Remington Research Group, showing Trump leading Hillary Clinton 46% to 42% in a four-way race, outside the the 2.2% margin of error.</p>, <p>Before Trump spoke, several local politicians addressed the event, including Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), a prominent conservative and a member of the House Select Committee on Benghazi.</p>, <p>In a plain-spoken presentation, Jordan slammed Obamacare, and argued that Clinton had disqualified herself from the presidency through her failures in Benghazi and her lies that follows.</p>, <p>\u201cAnyone who won\u2019t square with parents whose children gave their lives to this great nation should not be commander-in-chief,\u201d Jordan said, to roars of approval.</p>, <p><a href="/web/20161028153249/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/10/IMG_5001.jpg"><img alt='Donald Trump "balls" at rally (Joel Pollak / Breitbart News)' class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5383082" height="960" src="/web/20161028153249im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/10/IMG_5001.jpg" width="1280"/></a></p>, <p>There were fans of all ages in the crowd. Three generations of the Vanatta family came from nearby Englewood to see Trump speak \u2014 including 10-month-old baby Morgan, dressed in a homemade \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d onesie.</p>, <p><a href="/web/20161028153249/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/10/IMG_4991.jpg"><img alt="Morgan Vanatta at Trump rally in Springfield (Joel Pollak / Breitbart News)" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5383052" height="960" src="/web/20161028153249im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/10/IMG_4991.jpg" width="1280"/></a></p>, <p>They had been to see Mitt Romney four years before, in Dayton; they had also rallied for John McCain in 2008. But there was not as much excitement then as there is for Trump now, they said, recounting that they had sat in traffic for an hour just to reach the highway exit.</p>, <p>Mike Robinson of nearby Hamilton brought a homemade \u201cDrain The Swamp\u201d sign \u2014 a slogan that has been appearing frequently on do-it-yourself posters at recent Trump rallies.</p>, <p><a href="/web/20161028153249/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/10/IMG_4981.jpg"><img alt="Drain the Swamp Donald Trump rally (Joel Pollak / Breitbart News)" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5383047" height="960" src="/web/20161028153249im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/10/IMG_4981.jpg" width="1280"/></a></p>, <p>He predicted that Trump would win Ohio and the presidency. \u201cThey talk about an \u2018October surprise\u2019 \u2014 they\u2019re going to get a \u2018November surprise\u2019,\u201d he said.</p>, <p><a href="/web/20161028153249/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/10/IMG_5006.jpg"><img alt="Japanese Americans for Trump (Joel Pollak / Breitbart News)" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5383732" height="960" src="/web/20161028153249im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/10/IMG_5006.jpg" width="1280"/></a></p>, <p>Not everyone in the audience was a Trump supporter. One African-American teenager, Dantre Jackson of Springfield, told Breitbart News that he is supporting Hillary Clinton. \u201cDonald Trump could get it done, but he\u2019s only helping people who have businesses. Hillary is trying to help everybody,\u201d he said.</p>, <p>Another, Anthony Embry, also of Springfield, said he is not voting for either candidate. \u201cHillary\u2019s all about the women thing, but then we know what happened with her husband,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Trump is too crazy for me. I can\u2019t see how he can run the country. His rallies are violent, he\u2019s bringing hatred to America.\u201d</p>, <p>Trump also reiterated many familiar themes from earlier stump speeches, including his attacks on the North American Free Trade Agreement, his criticism of the Clintons\u2019 corruption, and his pledge to build a wall along the border with Mexico.</p>, <p>He had a message for Mexico\u2019s drug cartels, he said: when he is elected,\xa0\u201cyour long reign of crime, and terror, and horror, will come to a very beautiful, and crashing, end.\u201d</p>, <p>On the other side of the venue, one protester was removed by local law enforcement.</p>, <p><em>Joel B.
