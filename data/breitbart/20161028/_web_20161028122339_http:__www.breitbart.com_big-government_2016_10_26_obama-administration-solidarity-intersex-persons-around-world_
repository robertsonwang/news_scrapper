The Fund was launched in 2011 to support civil society in their efforts to advance human rights and uphold dignity for all.</p>, <p>Dr. Michelle Cretella, president of the American College of Pediatricians, <a href="/web/20161028132130/https://www.acpeds.org/the-college-speaks/position-statements/gender-dysphoria-in-children">writes</a> about this rare medical condition, known as a disorder of sex development:</p>, <p>Human sexuality is binary by design with the purpose being the reproduction of our species. This principle is self-evident. Barring one of the rare disorders of sex development (DSD), no infant is \u201cassigned\u201d a sex or a gender at birth; rather birth sex declares itself anatomically in utero and is clearly evident and acknowledged at birth.</p>, <p>The exceedingly rare DSDs, including but not limited to androgen insensitivity syndrome and congenital adrenal hyperplasia, are all medically identifiable deviations from the human binary sexual norm. Unlike individuals with a normal genotype and hormonal axis who identify as \u201ctransgender,\u201d those with DSD have an innate biological condition. Sex assignment in individuals with DSDs is complex and dependent on a variety of genetic, hormonal, and physical factors. Nevertheless, the 2006 consensus statement of the Intersex Society of North America did not endorse DSD as a third sex.</p>, <p>The American Psychological Association (APA) <a href="/web/20161028132130/http://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/intersex.aspx">defines</a> \u201cintersex\u201d:</p>, <p>A variety of conditions that lead to atypical development of physical sex characteristics are collectively referred to as <em>intersex conditions</em>. These conditions can involve abnormalities of the external genitals, internal reproductive organs, sex chromosomes or sex-related hormones.</p>, <p>APA goes on to discuss the process that takes place when a baby is diagnosed with DSD:</p>, <p>When a baby is born with ambiguous genitals, doctors perform examinations and laboratory tests to determine exactly what condition the baby has. Determining the type of intersex condition is important, because some intersex conditions that cause ambiguous genitals (for example, certain types of congenital adrenal hyperplasia) can be associated with medical problems that may require urgent medical or surgical treatment. Because we expect everyone to be identifiably male or female, the parents and family members of babies born with ambiguous genitals are usually eager to learn what condition the child has, so that sex assignment can occur without delay.</p>, <p>However, intersex activists have joined with the radical LGBTQ agenda to condemn attempts to provide surgery to infants born with this rare disorder, categorizing such intervention as the imposition of a gender identity onto a child.</p>, <p>Activist Morgan Carpenter of \u201cVisibly Intersex\u201d writes in a <a href="/web/20161028132130/http://intersexday.org/en/thinking-outside-box-carpenter/">blog post</a> on the Intersex Awareness Day website about the stated concerns:</p>, <p>We hear that parents demand surgeries; that the choice is between surgery or the foster care system. We also hear that parents don\u2019t know their child is visibly different until they are told. We hear that children with DSDs are not intersex. That they don\u2019t identify as intersex. That intersex advocates don\u2019t represent the interests of intersex children.</p>, <p>\u2026</p>, <p>What really matters is that we are able to make connections with our peers, and that we can dismantle the systems that cause shame and stigma. We share much in common with LGBT communities; we are more likely to be same sex attracted or transgender than non-intersex people, but our distinct issues need specific attention. LGBTI has to work for all constituent populations. We also have much in common with people with disabilities, and with the children\u2019s rights movement.</p>, <p>Nevertheless, APA <a href="/web/20161028132130/http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/susan-jones/obama-state-department-stands-solidarity-intersex-persons-around-world?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTkdNeVl6WmlaREZtTWpZMyIsInQiOiJLaDZpVDkrb1RUR2ROa3dSNlRTRXFqT2J1dVpYdXVYTXZSNVphZHhlZksyS01pUVd1WVlycmF1YWdqQ2dZRHNcL1ZhTG1TWGgrTndxbmRJK3drb3hnSXpUQW5pNWtwUTA1cFJcL1hmRlordlQwPSJ9">notes</a>, \u201cMost persons born with intersex conditions are happy with their assigned sex, just as most persons born without intersex conditions are.\u201d</p>, <p>The Intersex Society of North America <a href="/web/20161028132130/http://www.isna.org/faq/frequency">says</a> that \u201cabout 1 in 1500 to 1 in 2000 births\u201d are intersex cases.</p>]
