During an <a href="/web/20161028152955/http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/26/politics/wolf-blitzer-donald-trump-kellyanne-conway/">interview</a> with <a href="/web/20161028152955/https://twitter.com/KellyannePolls" target="_blank">Kellyanne Conway</a> on Tuesday, CNN\u2019s <a href="/web/20161028152955/https://twitter.com/wolfblitzer" target="_blank">Wolf Blitzer</a> breathlessly asked Trump\u2019s campaign manager to ask Trump to stop calling out the press at his rallies because he is scared \u201cthere could be an ugly incident\u201d between Trump supporters and the \u201chardworking young journalists\u201d who cover his rallies.</p>, <p>A quick review of media stories over the last two weeks reveals more than a dozen articles in major publications with the same \u201cjournalists victimized by Trump supporters at rallies\u201d narrative. Trump supporters endure long waits, messy parking, and often obstructed view seating to rally for their candidate. The press, on the other hand, is given their own entrance, sectioned off seating, and protection from event security and the Secret Service.</p>, <p>After an exhaustive search, this Breitbart reporter could find exactly zero incidences of members of the media being physically attacked or assaulted at Trump rallies. None of this has stopped the misleading characterization of Trump supporters creating a \u201cmenacing\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d environment for these special snowflakes.</p>, <p>The narrative sprung up briefly in August when <em>NBC</em>\u2018s <a href="/web/20161028152955/https://twitter.com/KatyTurNBC" target="_blank">Katy Tur</a> wrote a <a href="/web/20161028152955/http://www.marieclaire.com/politics/a21997/donald-trump-katy-tur/" target="_blank">long piece</a> in <em>Marie Claire</em>\xa0in which she gives her account of her confrontational relationship with Trump and the backlash his \u201cinsults\u201d on her reporting created with his supporters. Here is a small piece from her \u201cno-holds-barred\u201d account:</p>, <p>I was six months into covering the Trump campaign for MSNBC and NBC News, and there I was, in the belly of a World War II battleship, in a press pen made out of bicycle racks, surrounded by thousands of whipped-up Trump supporters.</p>, <p>\u2026</p>, <p>Trump decided to go further in Mount Pleasant, pointing his finger squarely at me and launching a personal attack as millions of Americans watched at home.</p>, <p>\u201cWhat a lie it was,\u201d Trump said, referring to the claim that he had left the stage abruptly. \u201cWhat a lie. Katy Tur. What a lie it was. Third. Rate. Reporter. Remember that.\u201d The crowd\u2019s boos ricocheted off the iron hull of the USS Yorktown.</p>, <p>Just a few days after the Tur piece was published, two other <em>NBC</em> press employees \u2014 <a href="/web/20161028152955/https://twitter.com/frankthorp" target="_blank">Frank Thorp</a> and <a href="/web/20161028152955/https://twitter.com/alivitali" target="_blank">Ali Vitali</a> \u2014 tweeted out pictures and videos of Trump supporters showing insufficient deference to the press.
