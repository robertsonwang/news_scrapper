[<p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>\u201cI\u2019m doing jake tapper and they have a national poll coming out. They wouldn\u2019t tell me results but if I had to guess it \u2013 discerning from our prep call -will show Bernie doing pretty well w Hillary and doing as well against Jeb or close to it,\u201d <a href="/web/20161028133451/https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/33895">wrote</a> Tanden on July 24, 2015, in an email revealed by Wikileaks.</p>, <p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>\u201cPS can you imagine what the Republicans would do to him if he were the nominee?\u201d Podesta replied that day.</p>, <p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s see what the poll actually says,\u201d Tanden said. \u201cLet\u2019s hope the Democratic party is not suicidal.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cDo we actually know who told Hillary she could use a private email? And has that person been drawn and quartered?\u201d Tanden added the next day. \u201cLike whole thing is fucking insane.\u201d</p>, <p>Clinton\u2019s unauthorized\xa0use of an unsecured email server stored in her bathroom while working as Secretary of State has been a millstone around her neck. She willfully ignored State Department protocol while leaving\xa0sensitive and classified information open to hacks by any foreign country looking to harm or gain advantage against the United States. Why the FBI chose not to indict her despite detailing a devastating case against her is unclear, but the use of private emails leads all the way to President Barack Obama. As longtime Clinton aide and counsel Cheryl Mills told Podesta, Obama himself had emails from Clinton sent from her unsecured server. \u201c[W]e need to clean this up \u2013 he has emails from her \u2013 they do not say state.gov,\u201d she <a href="/web/20161028133451/http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/25/wikileaks-cheryl-mills-obamas-hillary-email-denial-need-clean/">wrote</a> on March 7, 2015, after Obama claimed he only heard of Hillary\u2019s private server \u201cthrough news reports.\u201d</p>, <p>Clinton tried to blame former Secretary of State Colin Powell for telling her to use a private server while conducting government business, but Powell was having none of it, as Breitbart News previously <a href="/web/20161028133451/http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/25/hes-colin-powell-announces-plan-vote-hillary-clinton/">reported</a>:</p>, <p>In private emails, Powell<a class=" x5l" href="/web/20161028133451/https://theintercept.com/2016/09/13/colin-powell-emails/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> berated Clinton</a> for trying to drag him into her scandal.</p>, <p>\u201cEverything HRC touches she kind of screws up with hubris,\u201d he scoffed, after accusing them of messing up the handling of the story.</p>, <p>\u201cHRC could have killed this two years ago by merely telling everyone honestly what she had done and not tie me to it,\u201d he wrote to a friend. \u201cI told her staff three times not to try that gambit. I had to throw a mini tantrum at a Hampton\u2019s [sic] party to get their attention.\u201d</p>, <p>Tanden also works as president of the Center for American Progress, which Podesta founded in 2003.</p>]
