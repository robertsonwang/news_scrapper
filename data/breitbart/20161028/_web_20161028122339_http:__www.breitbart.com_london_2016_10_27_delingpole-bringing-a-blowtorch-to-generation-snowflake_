It\u2019s brilliant, it\u2019s funny, it\u2019s witty, it\u2019s insightful, it\u2019s fearlessly unPC, and it\u2019s been getting rave reviews on <a href="/web/20161028152618/https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/delingpole-james-delingpole/id1163810679">iTunes</a>. But though it\u2019s been out for a week \u2013 the first was a cracker of a\xa0chat with Katie Hopkins on everything from Israel and Donald Trump to why it\u2019s so nice being hated by all the right people \u2013 I\u2019ve only now got round to plugging it in print.</p>, <p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>Here is some of the stuff people have said so far \u2013 and I swear I did not make these quotes up. These are from genuine, actual listeners:</p>, <p><span class="user-info">by RockyMountainWay</span></p>, <p class="content" data-text-truncate-lines="5">Totally non-PC awesomeness. Thank you for doing this. It\u2019s music to my assailed ears.</p>, <p><span class="user-info">by xt0rt</span></p>, <p class="content" data-text-truncate-lines="5">\u2026and I don\u2019t drink gin.</p>, <p><span class="user-info">by Last Pagan</span></p>, <p class="content" data-text-truncate-lines="5">If you enjoy Delingpole\u2019s articles\u2014which are, I would argue, some of the most entertaining, witty, sarcastic, and certainly merciless\u2014then you might as well listen gladly to this amazing podcast, where Delingpole calmly and smoothly delineates the stupidity of the modern age. As an American reader of Breitbart news, this is a delight.</p>, <p>So now, let me whet your appetite for this week\u2019s show \u2013 which you can listen to now \u2013 with the wonderful <a href="/web/20161028152618/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Fox#In_the_media">Claire Fox.</a></p>, <p>Fox \u2013 probably best-known to British listeners as the voice of robust common sense on BBC Radio 4\u2019s The Moral Maze \u2013 recently published a characteristically punchy book called <a href="/web/20161028152618/https://www.amazon.com/Find-That-Offensive-Claire-Fox-ebook/dp/B01E5LHN22"><em>I Find That Offensive</em> (Biteback)</a>. It\u2019s about the rise and rise of Generation Snowflake \u2013 the whiny, needy, over-indulged, cry-bully offendotrons currently\xa0waging war on fun, sanity, and free speech on university campuses and in the media.</p>, <p>There were one or two of them in the audience at the Battle of Ideas (the <a href="/web/20161028152618/http://instituteofideas.com/aboutus/person/claire_fox">annual free speech festival</a> Claire Fox organises) last weekend and even next to me on one of the panels I was on. (I\u2019ll be posting up film of this when it has been edited by my assistant. Which is another thing I learned from Milo. Get an assistant.) One of my fellow panellists actually told the audience that she thought there should be a self-imposed rule for people when using Twitter: \u201cWould my grandmother\xa0feel comfortable with what I\u2019m about to say?\u201d</p>, <p>Someone in the audience pointed out that most people go on Twitter precisely to avoid reading stuff that would make grandma feel comfortable.</p>, <p>I agree.</p>, <p>But very tempting though it is to take the piss out of these Special Snowflake types at every opportunity, Claire Fox warned me against it.</p>, <p>\u201cThey\u2019re not a joke,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re a very serious problem, especially in the huge threat they pose to free speech.\u201d</p>, <p>At the beginning of her book, she gives two hugely depressing examples of the censorious narrow-mindedness of Generation Snowflake, both involving trips to speak at British schools.</p>, <p>The first was at a school with 90 per cent Muslim children where her audience \u201cscreeched in horror\u201d at her failure to refer to Mohammed as \u201cthe Prophet Mohammed\u201d. Fox explained she hadn\u2019t meant to cause offence and urged that they should try to listen to her arguments rather than be offended by a linguistic mistake. What struck Fox most forcibly was how genuinely hurt the children felt: \u201cIt became clear that these lovely, bright young people had found it difficult to hear my arguments without taking them personally.\u201d</p>, <p>Before you start dismissing this as just a Muslim problem, the second incident occurred at a mostly white school, this time when Fox sought to discuss the conviction for rape (since overturned) of footballer Ched Evans.</p>, <p>\u201cI decided, perhaps rashly, (quoting Germaine Greer for recognisable feminist cred), to tell them that rape was not necessarily the worst thing that could ever happen to an individual. Yes, it is a serious crime, but we need a sense of proportion. The room erupted. The audience shrieked. A teacher yelled out \u2018you can\u2019t say that\u2019. Girls were hugging each other for comfort. The majority seemed shell-shocked. Even\xa0<em>posing\xa0</em>this viewpoint was a step too far, it seemed. I was told that I was dangerous, irresponsible and offensive.\u201d</p>, <p>Who created these fragile, petulant \u2013 and, yes, terrifyingly dangerous \u2013 little monsters?</p>, <p>How on earth do we get our civilisation back?</p>, <p>Listen to Delingpole \u2013 my latest podcast with special guest Claire Fox \u2013 to find out.</p>, <p><iframe frameborder="0" height="696" src="/web/20161028152618if_/http://www.podcastone.com/embed?progID=968&amp;pid=1687791" width="300"></iframe></p>]
