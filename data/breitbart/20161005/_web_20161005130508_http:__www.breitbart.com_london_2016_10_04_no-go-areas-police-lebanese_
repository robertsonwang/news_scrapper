[<p>At around 10 o\u2019clock last Tuesday evening, police were called by concerned residents who alerted them to a mass brawl taking place outside a family restaurant in Erkrath-Hochdahl.</p>, <p>Around 150 members of a Lebanese extended family and about two dozen bikers from a Hells Angels chapter, many of them also with a Lebanese background, were fighting one another with fists and broom handles.</p>, <p>A significant\xa0deployment of police arrived at the scene after the bikers had eventually barricaded themselves in a nearby pub. More than 100 officers were involved in trying to settle the dispute between the two groups and a police helicopter monitored the situation from the air, all of which lasted until the early hours of the morning.</p>, <p>Police report that the two groups have clashed before, beating each other with sticks and batons in another fight in August which required more than 100 police officers to bring the situation under control.</p>, <p>The two factions claim their confrontation in August was about an argument over a parking lot but police believe the sides\u2019 enmity is part of a bigger dispute between the two clans.</p>, <p>\u201cWe do not know the true background. It is certainly not a biker war. Rather, we believe that this is a dispute between two clans, with the connections the biker group has,\u201d\xa0Mettmann District police spokesman Ulrich L\xf6he said.</p>, <p>The <em>Cologne City Gazette</em> <a href="/web/20161005191248/http://www.ksta.de/nrw/gewalttaetige-clan-exzesse-massenschlaegerei-befeuert-sorge-um-sicherheit--24820404">notes</a> that the confrontation would likely reignite the ongoing debate over the politically sensitive issue of no-go areas. Christian Democratic Union (CDU) interior expert Gregor Golland recently warned: \u201cIn North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) there are districts where clans have taken over the streets. After sunset, people and the authorities no longer dare leave the house.\u201d</p>, <p>Asserting that areas of Germany are spiralling into lawlessness, Mr.\xa0Golland said: \u201cWe must be careful that these districts not slip completely.\u201d</p>, <p>The Gazette reports that gangs and clans have taken control in neighbourhoods across the state\u2019s metropolises including Duisburg, Gelsenkirchen, Essen, Cologne, Dortmund, Aachen, and Bochum. Violence against the police has risen as much as 50 per cent in many of these areas.</p>, <p>In the Duisberg district of Marxloh last summer, a female police officer was heavily beaten by a mob from a Lebanese clan while recording a traffic accident. Her colleague was only able to restrain the attackers by drawing his handgun.</p>, <p>In December last year, the police chief of Gelsenkirchen met with leaders of the Lebanese clans after months of violence. The men made clear that they weren\u2019t wanting to negotiate peaceful coexistence with the force, telling him the police \u201cwill not win a war with the Lebanese, because we are too many.\u201d</p>, <p>Members of the \u201cFamily Union\u201d clan were unimpressed when the police chief announced the force planned to send more officers to \u201cproblem areas\u201d in the town.</p>, <p>According to an internal police report, the men said: \u201cThe country has no money to be using so many policemen to seek confrontation with the Lebanese.\u201d</p>, <p>Germany\u2019s Home Office completely denies the existence of no-go areas. Interior Minister Ralf J\xe4ger said: \u201cIn North Rhine-Westphalia there are no lawless areas. The NRW police drive their police cars down every street in every district.\u201d</p>, <p>Interior expert Golland said he considers the Interior Minister\u2019s statement \u201cwindow dressing\u201d. \u201cPeople that address the problems are denounced as traitors\u201d. Similarly, the Free Democratic Party\u2019s interior expert Marc L\xfcrbke told the Gazette: \u201cCertain districts are now associated with significant risks for state officials.\u201d</p>, <p>The staffing situation of NRW\u2019s police force remains difficult. Responding to a question about how the number of cases of pickpocketing in Cologne is skyrocketing, the Interior Ministry\u2019s department head said policing would need to be \u201cthinned out\u201d in rural areas. The result, Wolfgang D\xfcren admitted, is that police can now only afford to give \u201ca minimum level of protection for the population\u201d.</p>, <p>The police union in the state (GdP) is viewing the situation in no-go zones with concern. GdP board member Volker Husz said: \u201cThe problem districts have significantly worsened in recent years.</p>, <p>\u201cOfficials are insulted and threatened while they record traffic accidents, ambulance workers are attacked. We cannot let [this behaviour] pass.\u201d</p>]
