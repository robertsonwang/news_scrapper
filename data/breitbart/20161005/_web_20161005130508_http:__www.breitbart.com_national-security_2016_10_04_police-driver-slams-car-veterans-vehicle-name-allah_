[<p>Scott Alcala, the veteran, declared that the collision amounts to a terrorist act and wants the driver,\xa0Ameer Abbaf Fakhraldin, off the streets.</p>, <p>\u201cHe was just trying to target as many people as he could,\u201d he explained. \u201cHe was just trying to cause a pile up. It wasn\u2019t me personally. It was as if someone were to throw a bomb in the middle of downtown, it\u2019s no different, it\u2019s the same thinking.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cComing back from Afghanistan, thinking I\u2019m on home soil I\u2019m safe now\u2026 just shouldn\u2019t have to worry about something like that, you know,\u201d he also said.</p>, <p>In explaining why he crashed into the veteran\u2019s automobile, Fakhraldin also cited what he described as Republican Presidential Nominee Donald Trump\u2019s mistreatment of minorities.</p>, <p>Alcala was on his way from Fresno to San Jose to play golf with his father when the disturbed driver slammed into him.</p>, <p>\u201cI saw the Suburban coming right at me about to T-bone right into the driver door and I thought that was it. A second later I turned my head and just smashed into the barrier,\u201d said the Veteran.</p>, <p><a href="/web/20161005130050/http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/10/02/driver-plowed-his-vehicle-into-veterans-car-in-name-allah-police-say.html">Fox News</a> reports:</p>, <p>Alcala said that when an off-duty police officer went to talk to Fakhraldin, he said that he caused the collision in the name of Allah. He also cited Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump\u2019s treatment of minorities for why he caused the crash.</p>, <p>Fakhraldin told an officer at the scene that he estimated his own speed to be 200 mph and that he caused the crash using psychic/telekinetic powers to control the steering. The officer said Fakhraldin showed no remorse, Fox 26 reported, citing the police report.</p>, <p>Jihadi groups such as al Qaeda and its rival the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) have urged supporters to target military personnel. Various \u201c<a href="/web/20161005130050/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/01/27/islamic-state-vows-to-avenge-killing-of-top-hacker/">kill lists</a>\u201d containing personal information about U.S. service members, government employees, and civilians have been published online by jihadists.</p>, <p>It remains unclear how the Fakhraldin chose Alcala as a target or if he was affiliated with any specific Islamic extremist group. In July, a jihadist in France <a href="/web/20161005130050/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/07/15/france-truck-attack-ultimate-soft-target-hundreds-indefensible-people-watching-fireworks-national-holiday/">plowed a 19-ton truck</a> down Nice\u2019s Promenade des Anglais and into a crowd assembled for a July 14 fireworks display, killing 86 and wounding more than 200. His victims include children.</p>, <p>The carnage ended when police killed the armed truck driver, Tunisian Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel, after he drove onto a sidewalk for more than a mile. Bouhlel is believed to have been inspired by ISIS, which <a href="/web/20161005130050/http://wivb.com/2016/09/20/8-new-arrests-in-france-truck-attack-that-killed-86-in-nice/">claimed responsibility</a> for the attack.</p>, <p>Both al-Qaeda and ISIS have urged jihadists to carry out vehicular assaults against Western countries in the absence of more conventional weapons.</p>]
