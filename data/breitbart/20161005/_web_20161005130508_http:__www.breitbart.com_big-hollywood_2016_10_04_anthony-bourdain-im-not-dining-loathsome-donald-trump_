[<p>\u201cAbsolutely fucking not,\u201d Bourdain said when asked whether he might\xa0interview the Republican presidential candidate.</p>, <p>In an <a href="/web/20161005062258/http://www.thewrap.com/anthony-bourdain-dining-donald-trump-exclusive/" target="_blank">interview</a> with the Wrap,\xa0the award winning chef and\xa0New York City native said he\u2019s long believed Trump to be a \u201cloathsome\u201d man and would have turned down dinner\xa0with the White House hopeful \u201c10 years ago.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been a New Yorker most of my life, [and] for better or worse Mr. Trump is a New Yorker,\u201d <a href="/web/20161005062258/http://www.thewrap.com/anthony-bourdain-dining-donald-trump-exclusive/" target="_blank">Bourdain told</a> the entertainment news site. \u201cWe know him well here. We\u2019ve watched how he does business and we\u2019ve watched him say things and then we\u2019ve seen whether or not he did those things, we have seen how he treats the people he does business with. I would give the same answer that I would have given 10 years ago, when he was just as loathsome.\u201d</p>, <p>Bourdain\u2019s bitter remarks toward Trump came on the heels of the eighth season premiere of his five-time Emmy Award winning show, which featured none other than President Obama.</p>, <p>However, Bourdain rejects\xa0the idea of featuring politicos on his show and said Obama\u2019s appearance \u201ckind of fell in our lap.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t reach out to the White House,\u201d he added.\xa0\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s something I\u2019m anxious to do again. It\u2019s something I\u2019m really grateful I did this time around but it was an extraordinary occurrence.\u201d</p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="557" src="/web/20161005062258if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/4DNyVijKAP0?start=100&amp;feature=oembed" width="990"></iframe></p>, <p>When asked \u2014 having traveled extensively\xa0and experienced various cultures as part of his television show \u2014 if he sees America\u2019s issues differently,\xa0Bourdain said that Europe has seen \u201ca lot of sort of white nationalism and alt-right. A lot of anti-immigrant sentiment, a lot of fear and undirected anger but I\u2019ve never seen in my lifetime the kind of national conversation that we\u2019re actually having in the open now.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cIt would have been unthinkable at any point in my life, eight years ago, if a candidate for a major party was endorsed by the America Nazi Party and the Aryan Nation it\u2019s something [major figures] would feel obliged to denounce. Now, that apparently isn\u2019t reason enough to say anything.\u201d</p>, <p>Asked if he\u2019s detected a change in how people around the world view America, the chef said \u201cI mean, there is a sense of utter disbelief, everywhere I go, at Mr. Trump.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cThat is for sure. I mean, I\u2019m talking among our allies, England, France Germany, Italy,\u201d Bourdain continued. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst thing you can find. It\u2019s one thing to be despised or held in contempt or feared, but to be ridiculed or pitied\xa0is a terrible thing.\u201d</p>, <p>The Nashville episode of <em>Parts Unknown</em> airs on Sunday at 9 p.m. EST on CNN.</p>, <p>\xa0</p>, <p><em>Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter:\xa0<a href="/web/20161005062258/https://twitter.com/JeromeEHudson" target="_blank">@JeromeEHudson</a></em></p>]
