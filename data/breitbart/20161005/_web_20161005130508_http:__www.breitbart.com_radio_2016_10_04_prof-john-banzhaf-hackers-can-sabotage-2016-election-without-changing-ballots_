[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI think we should be very worried,\u201d he told SiriusXM host Alex Marlow:</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is something you and I discussed more than a month ago, and even more recently, just the headlines this morning \u2013 the Homeland Security Secretary is urging states to get help. People in Pennsylvania have been alerted to possible attacks. There\u2019s a report of a secret meeting between the FBI and the voting officials in Florida. So this is serious enough we ought to start </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">doing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">something about it.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I\u2019ve outlined why there\u2019s at least five major factors which we\u2019re worried about, the so-called \u201c</span><a href="/web/20161005062101/http://www.breitbart.com/radio/2016/09/28/prof-john-banzhaf-we-are-heading-into-perfect-storm-election-fraud/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">perfect storm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,\u201d but I think maybe we should be talking also about what we can do about it because time is running out.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There aren\u2019t too many things we can do. Some of the things we can do, we might want to do if we had more time, like getting some of them off the Internet, or making sure that the voting machines have an audit trail, or eliminating voting over the Internet \u2013 these are things we can\u2019t do in the remaining weeks. There are only a few things we can do.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marlow noted that the initial estimate of 12 state election systems assaulted by hackers was swiftly revised up to 23, which Banzhaf said was a sign that Homeland Security is taking the threat seriously, along with other cyber-warfare threats to \u201ccritical infrastructure,\u201d like electric power grids and water systems:</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, we\u2019ve been told that hackers might be able to take over nuclear power plants. They might be able to disable our entire financial system. They might be able to take over our electric grid. They might be able to shut down all of our aviation. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nobody can say that it\u2019s a five percent probability, or even a one percent probability, but given how serious it is, we have to pay attention. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bear in mind, again, you don\u2019t necessarily have to change the outcome of the election. All you\u2019ve got to do is create some kind of reasonable doubt about the validity of our presidential election. All you have to do is have one or two voting irregularities, particularly in close states like Ohio, for example. All you\u2019d need is for a screen to pop up and say, \u201cYou\u2019ve been hacked by blah blah blah blah.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People could be worried, particularly if the losing candidate gets up and says, \u201cYeah, the election was stolen.\u201d If the American people lose confidence in our presidential election, we have a major constitutional crisis \u2013 which could be worse than grounding our airplanes for a day or screwing up our financial system for a day.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banzhaf cited a 2012 article that noted President Obama\u2019s re-election campaign had \u201crecruited a legion of lawyers to be on standby for this year\u2019s election, as legal disputes surrounding the voting process escalate.\u201d The article said that \u201cthousands of attorneys\u201d had agreed to provide \u201cmassive legal support that appears to be unrivaled by Republicans or precedent.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cWhat I\u2019m suggesting, what I\u2019m thinking is likely to happen, is that each of the major parties, in addition to having lawyers standing by in case there are legal disputes, should possibly have their own volunteer cyber SWAT teams, or cyber-warriors, or whatever you want on standby,\u201d he said of the current election contest.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI mean, if you get a report of a possible irregularity in a voting machine, or a possible tampering with the election process, that\u2019s not the time to get on the phone and start calling around to professors who teach computers,\u201d Banzhaf warned:</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You want to have people standing by. When you get a report of an irregularity, they should be ready to swoop in, to check for it, to preserve the digital evidence, to make sure it isn\u2019t tampered with. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If their software has to be updated, for example, you want to have two people standing by: one for the Republicans, one for the Democrats, to make sure that they are legitimately uploading good software, not putting in some backdoor-type stuff.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u2026</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think there ought to be, in addition to lawyers and election-watchers, there ought to be people who have skills in computers to be able to come in and take appropriate steps if irregularities are suspected or detected. I think it would be a very good idea for the federal government, with or without the states, to come out with some protocols and guidelines in terms of malware and firewall protection, and so on and so forth. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banzhaf said he had recently seen an article entitled \u201cHow to Hack an Election Machine,\u201d which discussed techniques such as \u201cdigital ballot stuffing,\u201d and suggested that \u201cif hackers are able to influence the data that is being pushed to the media, or on social media, through the election machines, they can potentially influence those still to vote, and thus the election, because voters tend to follow the poll leader.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cYou don\u2019t even have to hack any election machine at all. If you got into the machines or the devices or the network that feeds the information to major networks, the mainstream media so-called, and you show X is running far ahead of Y,\u201d he explained, \u201cthat could influence the election right there,\u201d adding, \u201cSo there\u2019s lots of ways it could happen.\u201d</span></p>, <p><em>Breitbart News Daily</em> airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m.\xa0to 9:00 a.m.\xa0Eastern.</p>, <p><strong>LISTEN:</strong></p>, <p><iframe frameborder="no" height="400" scrolling="no" src="/web/20161005062101if_/https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F285990522&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;maxwidth=990&amp;maxheight=1000" width="990"></iframe></p>]
