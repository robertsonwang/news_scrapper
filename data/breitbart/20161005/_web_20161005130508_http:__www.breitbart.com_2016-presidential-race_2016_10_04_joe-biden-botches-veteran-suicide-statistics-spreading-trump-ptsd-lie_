But a lot of people can\u2019t handle it. And they see horror stories. They see events that you couldn\u2019t see in a movie, nobody would believe it.</p>, <p>Now we need a mental health help and medical. And it\u2019s one of the things that I think is least addressed and is one of the things that \u2014 like your question \u2014 one of the things that I hear the most about when I go around and talk to the veterans. So we\u2019re going to have a very, very robust, level of performance having to do with mental health. We are losing so many great people that can be taken care of if they have proper care.</p>, <p>You know when you hear the 22 suicides a day it\u2019s a big part of your question. But when you hear the 22 suicides a day that should never be. That should never be. So we\u2019re going to be addressing that very strongly and the whole mental health issue is going to be a very important issue when I take over and the V.A. is going to be fixed in so many ways but that\u2019s going to be one of the ways we\u2019re going to help.</p>]
