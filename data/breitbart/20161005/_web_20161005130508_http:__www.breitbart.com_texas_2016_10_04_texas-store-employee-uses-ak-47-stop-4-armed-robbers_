[<p>Jeffery Turner, Jr., owner of Jeff\u2019s Jewelry Store in Conroe, told police that four men entered his store and demanded jewelry, purses and other items. At least one of the robbers displayed a firearm, <a href="/web/20161005180634/http://montgomerycountypolicereporter.com/conroe-pd-statement-on-armed-robbery-shooting/">according to</a> Montgomery County Police Reporter\u2019s Scott Engle. One of Turner\u2019s employees responded by pulling an AK-47 semi-automatic rifle from behind the counter. The gunman fired at the store employees and a firefight ensued. At least three employees were said to have fired weapons at the robbery suspects.</p>, <p>The suspect who began shooting was struck and killed in the gun fight. The other three suspects escaped\xa0in a white Dodge Charger. Police found the Charger not far from the scene of the robbery. The suspects in the failed robbery attempt had abandoned the car and remain at large, Engle reported.</p>, <p>Police have not yet released the identity of the deceased suspect.</p>, <p>The attempted robbery took place on Monday afternoon at about 12:30 p.m.</p>, <p>Turner\u2019s attorney, E. Tay Bond, spoke with the<a href="/web/20161005180634/http://www.yourhoustonnews.com/courier/news/shoot-out-during-conroe-jewelry-store-robbery-leaves-one-assailant/article_010763df-558b-5c13-b8fd-6e63bfb7fb76.html" target="_blank"> Conroe Courier\u2019s Catherine Dominguez</a>. \u201cYou always have a right to defend yourself, especially when the robber shoots at you.\u201d Bond confirmed that Turner keeps an AK-47 in the store for defensive purposes.</p>, <p>The AK-47 rifle is manufactured in both automatic and semi-automatic models. In a semi-automatic weapon you must pull the trigger each time you want to fire. An automatic weapon will fire as long as you hold the trigger, until you run out of ammunition.</p>, <p>Conroe Police Department\u2019s Lt. Dorcy McGinnis told the Conroe newspaper,\xa0\u201cThere was a lot of gunfire. She reported the store\u2019s windows were broken out from the \u201cbullet spray.\u201d</p>, <p>Texas\u2019 \u201cCastle Doctrine\u201d laws allow a business owner or employee to have a weapon for self-defense and to use that weapon to protect their life and the lives of others.</p>, <p>Turner\u2019s store had previously been robbed in 2014 when a group of men smashed through the glass door with a sledgehammer. At that time, Dominguez reported, one of the employees grabbed a shotgun and the would-be robbers said, \u201cThey\u2019ve got guns. Let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p>, <p>The store employees were\xa0able to successfully stop the robbery and protect the lives of other\xa0employees and customers who were threatened by the armed gunmen.</p>, <p>A search for the suspects, which included support from a Drug Enforcement Agency helicopter, was not successful and the police manhunt continues. It has not been reported if any of the other suspects were injured in the hail of gunfire.</p>, <p><em><a href="/web/20161005180634/http://www.breitbart.com/author/bob-price/">Bob Price</a>\xa0serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.
