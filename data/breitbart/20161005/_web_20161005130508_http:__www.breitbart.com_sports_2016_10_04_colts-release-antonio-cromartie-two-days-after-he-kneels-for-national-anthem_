[<p>Cromartie crouched down on a knee and raised a black-power fist for the playing of \u201cThe Star Spangled Banner\u201d in London. Then he rose to his feet for \u201cGod Save the Queen.\u201d</p>, <p>But his play during the game, rather than his antics before it, likely led to his release.</p>, <p>The Colts lost the game to the longtime divisional doormat Jacksonville Jaguars 30-27. Jaguars QB Blake Bortles threw for 207 yards and two touchdowns. He ran for another score. Cromartie made four tackles at the Wembley Stadium matchup.</p>, <p>\u201cThe four-time Pro Bowler struggled throughout and his play with the Colts was summed up by one series during their Week 4 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars in London,\u201d ESPN\u2019s Mike Wells <a href="/web/20161005061954/http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/17714161/indianapolis-colts-release-antonio-cromartie-sio-moore">writes</a>. \u201cCromartie was beaten twice and called for two penalties on a drive where the Jaguars managed to get a field goal as the first half came to an end. Cromartie was benched in favor of Rashaan Melvin in the second half.\u201d</p>, <p>The Colts rank 30th in points allowed, 24th in passing yards allowed, and 24th in team defense this young season. At 1-3, the team\u2019s generous defense accounts for their last-place standing in a weak division.</p>, <p>Cromartie also took a knee for the anthem and raised his clenched fist (pictured above) before a win against the San Diego Chargers at Lucas Oil Stadium a week ago Sunday. That resulted in no repercussions, suggesting the aging corner\u2019s play rather than his political stance catalyzed his release.</p>, <p>Cromartie signed a $3 million deal with the Colts prior to the season. He needed the money. Fathering a dozen children by eight different women, with twins arriving last year after a vasectomy, the prolific 32-year-old <a href="/web/20161005061954/http://nypost.com/2016/01/17/antonio-cromartie-pays-336k-every-year-to-support-8-kids/">reportedly</a> owes $336,000 annually in child support. He reportedly <a href="/web/20161005061954/http://www.breitbart.com/sports/2016/08/24/baby-mama-drama-averted-contract-allows-father-of-12-antonio-cromartie-to-pay-child-support/">averted</a> baby-mama drama, and the consequences of a Florida non-support warrant in the offseason, by signing with the Colts.</p>, <p>Cromartie boasts 31 interceptions in eleven seasons with the Chargers, Jets, Cardinals, and Colts. The four-time Pro Bowler came up with a goose egg in the category this season before his release.</p>]
