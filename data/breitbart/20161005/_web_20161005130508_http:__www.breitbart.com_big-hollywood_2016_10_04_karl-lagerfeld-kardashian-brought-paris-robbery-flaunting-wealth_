[<p>The 83-year-old Chanel chief accused the <em>Keeping up with the Kardashians</em> star of being \u201ctoo public\u201d with her wealth before she was <a href="/web/20161005062236/http://www.breitbart.com/california/2016/10/04/update-10-million-kim-kardashian-robbery/" target="_blank">robbed at gunpoint</a> inside her Paris hotel room this week, with the thieves reportedly making off with more than $10 million in jewelry.</p>, <p>\u201cYou cannot display your wealth then be surprised that some people want to share it,\u201d Lagerfeld told reporters after the Chanel show at Paris Fashion Week on Tuesday, <a href="/web/20161005062236/http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/E/EU_FRANCE_PARIS_FASHION_WEEK_WATCH?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2016-10-04-13-32-58" target="_blank">according to</a> the Associated Press.</p>, <p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why (Kardashian) was in a hotel with no security and things like this,\u201d he added. \u201cIf you are that famous and you put all your jewelry on the net you go to hotels where nobody can come near to the room.\u201d</p>, <p>Lagerfeld\u2019s comments come as Kardashian has faced similar criticism from her former bodyguard Steve Stanulis, who told the <em>New York Post</em>\u2018s Page Six on Monday that he believes the Paris robbery was an <a href="/web/20161005062236/http://pagesix.com/2016/10/03/kimyes-former-security-guard-thinks-robbery-was-an-inside-job/" target="_blank">inside job</a>.</p>, <p>\u201cKim\u2019s social media and her Snapchat is her undoing,\u201d Stanulis told the paper. \u201cWhen she is posting, \u2018Here I am, and this is the $5 million ring I am wearing, here\u2019s where I am going,\u2019 you are basically inviting someone to rob you.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cSadly, the only person to blame for this incident is Kim Kardashian,\u201d Stanulis charged. \u201cShe has tens of millions of dollars of jewelry, but she can\u2019t pay for an armed guard to protect her? The fact that five days ago that someone broke through her security chain and tried to grab her, then this happened, shows her security is not strong enough, and this should be a wake-up call.\u201d</p>, <p>Kardashian reportedly left Paris in a private jet immediately after the robbery, and her husband Kanye West cut short a New York City concert in order to be at her side. West has also postponed several upcoming tour dates.</p>, <p>Lagerfeld said the Kardashian robbery was \u201ca very bad thing for Paris\u201d in terms of the city\u2019s image. In July, the fashion legend \u2014 who has lived and worked in Paris since the 1950s \u2014 said that the city is now an <a href="/web/20161005062236/http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2016/07/12/fashion-legend-karl-lagerfeld-paris-nightmare-now/" target="_blank">unsafe \u201cnightmare.\u201d</a></p>, <p>\u201cWe make all of these efforts to make Paris appealing and then this happens,\u201d Lagerfeld told reporters, <a href="/web/20161005062236/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3821465/Lagerfeld-chastises-Kim-Kardashian-flaunting-diamonds.html" target="_blank">according to</a> the <em>Daily Mail</em>.</p>, <p>\xa0</p>, <p><em>Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: <a href="/web/20161005062236/https://twitter.com/dznussbaum" target="_blank">@dznussbaum</a></em></p>]
