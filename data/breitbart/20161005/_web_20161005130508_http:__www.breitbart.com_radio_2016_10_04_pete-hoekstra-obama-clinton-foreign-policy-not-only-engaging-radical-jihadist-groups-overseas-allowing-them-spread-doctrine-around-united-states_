[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hoekstra told SiriusXM host Alex Marlow that a presidential directive is \u201cdeveloped by an inter-agency group within the executive branch, usually headed by the State Department, and it then outlines U.S. foreign policy in whatever area it was tasked to study.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cIn this case, back in 2009 and 2010, this group got together, and they articulated a new policy for the United States government towards the Middle East, especially toward various Muslim groups in the Middle East,\u201d Hoekstra continued. \u201cThis directive, we believe, specifically directed U.S. government agencies \u2013 State Department employees, ambassadors, and those types of things \u2013 to begin engaging with radical jihadist groups, believing that if we would engage with radical jihadist groups, they would change their behavior toward the United States.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cIt led to the overthrow of Mubarak in Egypt. It led to the overthrow of Qaddafi in Libya. Libya obviously ended up with catastrophic results, and we almost lost Egypt at the same time,\u201d he recalled.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marlow found it remarkable that so little was being made of\xa0Hillary Clinton\u2019s role in crafting Obama\u2019s disastrous foreign policy in the current election cycle.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right,\u201d said Hoekstra, elaborating:</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take a look. When President Obama \u2013 we completed this study at the </span><a href="/web/20161005062042/http://www.investigativeproject.org/author/Pete+Hoekstra"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investigative Project on Terrorism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where I now spend my time \u2013 in 2008, 2009, when this President and Hillary Clinton took over the government, there were roughly 3,300 people per year who were losing their lives as a result of radical jihadism. Today, that number is approaching almost 30,000 people per year. Iraq is a failed state. Syria is a failed state. Yemen is a failed state. Libya is a failed state. And Afghanistan is a failed state.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThe media doesn\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d he observed. \u201cObviously, Hillary Clinton doesn\u2019t want to talk about it because their role in national security has destabilized the Middle East and northern Africa. It has led to increasing deaths in massive refugee flows throughout the Middle East, Europe, and again Northern Africa.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Marlow observed that regime-change philosophy under both Bush and Obama has been criticized by some conservatives, Hoekstra noted there were some important differences between the two administrations:</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the Bush administration, at least we removed dictators who were hostile to the United States \u2013 Afghanistan and Iraq.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Egypt and Libya, we actually removed a President Mubarak who for \u2013 what, 20 or 25 years? \u2013 had done everything the United States had asked him to do to maintain stability in the Middle East.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Libya, we had a wonderful experience where Qaddafi actually flipped sides, turned over his nuclear weapons, paid reparations, and joined us in the fight against radical jihadists. And after eight years of doing everything America asked him to do, Hillary Clinton declared that he needed to go. The United States, along with NATO, we removed Qaddafi, and it has now been a failed state.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other thing is, which you\u2019ll see on this, is not only are we engaging with radical jihadist groups overseas, in this regime change, we\u2019re also allowing some of these same people to come into the United States, providing them access to the White House, providing them access to the State Department, and allowing them to go around the country and make speeches, and spread their doctrine around the United States. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So this PSD-11 had nothing to do with national security. There\u2019s no sources or methods. It\u2019s just a strategy. But obviously, this is something that we think the Obama administration ought to make public, and I doubt that they </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">make it public because the results of this policy have not been very good.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hoekstra suspected this dramatic change in U.S. foreign policy was \u201cprobably a creation of Ben Rhodes, the person who worked for the President as an assistant national security adviser\u201d:</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the whole spin back in 2009, 2010, that there\u2019s this Arab Spring moving through the Middle East, the forces for democracy and reform, free markets, and those types of things. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As David Ignatius \u2013 a liberal columnist \u2013 wrote, this is really a gamble, a roll of the dice as he described it, by the Obama administration, embracing these forces of change in the Middle East with the expectation that positive things would happen. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, if they would have peeled back the layers on these groups at all, they would have recognized it was not a roll of the dice; it was a high-risk, high-gamble, and it didn\u2019t pay off. So the Obama administration, Hillary Clinton, decided to throw out 30 years of foreign policy that brought some stability to the Middle East, and the result was, they failed. And the results have been horrendous. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerning\xa0the seven major Obama foreign interventions Hoekstra covered in his </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Examiner </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">piece, he said, \u201cThe only one that has any tentative success, you could argue, would be Tunisia \u2013 but even there, Tunisia is close to the tipping point, in terms of going in the wrong direction.\u201d</span></p>, <p><em>Breitbart News Daily</em> airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m.\xa0to 9:00 a.m.\xa0Eastern.</p>, <p><strong>LISTEN:</strong></p>, <p><iframe frameborder="no" height="400" scrolling="no" src="/web/20161005062042if_/https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F285990315&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;maxwidth=990&amp;maxheight=1000" width="990"></iframe></p>]
