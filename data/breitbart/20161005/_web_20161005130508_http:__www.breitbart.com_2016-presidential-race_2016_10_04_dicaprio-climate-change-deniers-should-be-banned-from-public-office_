[<p>Speaking on a platform at the inaugural South By South Lawn event at the White House with President Obama and alarmist scientist Katharine Hayhoe, <a href="/web/20161005185750/http://www.breitbart.com/wp-admin/">DiCaprio</a> told his enraptured\xa0audience:</p>, <p>\u201cThe scientific consensus is in and the argument is now over.\xa0If you do not believe in climate change, you do not believe in facts, or in science or empirical truths and therefore, in my humble opinion, should not be allowed to hold public office.\u201d</p>, <p>DiCaprio was there mainly to promote his new <a href="/web/20161005185750/http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2016/09/28/watch-dicaprio-fights-climate-change-flood-trailer/">National Geographic disaster-porn</a> documentary <em>Before the Flood\xa0</em>in which he tours the world by private jet talking to celebrities who agree with him on climate change \u2013 President Obama, Pope Francis, Elon Musk \u2013 and also canvassing\xa0the opinions of picturesque natives in exotic locations all testifying in a range of languages and accents that, yes, man-made climate change really is the worst thing ever and they can see its effects all around them.</p>, <p>Obama \u2013 watch the <a href="/web/20161005185750/http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/299097-dicaprio-climate-change-deniers-shouldnt-hold-public-office">video</a> if you can bear \u2013 was in full \u201cI don\u2019t want you to think of me of anything so boring as President of the USA. I want you to think of me more like a Hollywood movie star, like Leo, who is totally down with the kids and really cool\u201d mode. He took the opportunity to reiterate just how incredibly important an issue climate change is \u2013 as indeed he would, given that if this isn\u2019t the case then he has just gone and blown two whole terms of a US presidency on absolutely nothing.</p>, <p>Hayhoe, meanwhile, was there to lend the event the veneer of scientific credibility.</p>, <p>She was certainly right on one thing. The bit where she said:</p>, <p>\u201cWe are pouring all of our money, all of our effort, all of our prayers into a bucket and the bucket has a hole in the bottom. That hole is climate change.\u201d</p>, <p>This is probably the truest, wisest, cleverest thing any climate alarmist scientist has ever said in history \u2013 even the truth only came out by accident and not in the way she intended.</p>, <p>But yes, the whole climate change industry is indeed like pouring trillions of dollars (and hope and effort and prayers, etc) into a bucket with an almighty hole in it.</p>, <p>Here, by way of a reminder, is the rough annual cost of the climate change industry \u2013 <a href="/web/20161005185750/http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/08/08/climate-change-the-hoax-that-costs-us-4-billion-a-day/">$1.5 trillion.</a></p>, <p>And <a href="/web/20161005185750/http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/11/10/cost-climate-change-1-5-trillion-year-reduce-global-warming-0-048c/">here </a>is what the combined decarbonisation efforts of the world\u2019s industrial and developing nations are going to achieve by the end of the century thanks to the vital COP21 summit in Paris last year.</p>, <p>A reduction in global temperatures by the end of the century of 0.048 degrees C \u2013 ie around 1/20th of a degree C.</p>, <p>If this represents a sensible use of scarce resources, I would love to hear<a href="/web/20161005185750/http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2015/12/10/leo-dicaprio-now-officially-joke-canada-confuses-chinook-wind-climate-change/"> acclaimed climate expert</a> and economist Leonardo DiCaprio explain how. Then perhaps he could go on to explain the still <a href="/web/20161005185750/http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2016/08/17/leonardo-dicaprio-foundation-tied-3b-malaysian-embezzlement-scheme/">unexplained mystery </a>of the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation\u2019s connections with a $3 billion \xa0Malaysian embezzlement scheme.</p>]
