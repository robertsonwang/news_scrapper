[<p>The show, <a href="/web/20161005062721/https://igg.me/at/daddywillsaveus">which is currently selling tickets on IndieGoGo</a> to raise the necessary funds to pay for the event, <a href="/web/20161005062721/http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/09/04/gay-conservative-behind-twinks4trump-takes-on-liberal-puritans/">will feature Wintrich\u2019s iconic \u201cTwinks4Trump\u201d photoshoot</a>, as well as a series of new installations.</p>, <p>Milo is a featured artist at the event, and will submit an original piece of artwork to the show. Conservative commentator and\xa0<em>Vice\xa0</em>co-founder Gavin McInnes and pharmaceutical entrepreneur and leftist folk villain Martin Shkreli will also submit pieces.</p>, <p>Additional contributors include Martin Shkreli, James O\u2019Keefe, the Godesky Brothers, Jon Proby, Sebastian Sommer, and more.</p>, <p>\u201cI think this exhibition will fight the dogma of a single accepted political ideology among artists and the creative class as a whole,\u201d said Wintrich, the New York City resident behind Twinks4Trump.</p>, <p>\u201cI lost my job, received copious death threats, and to add insult to injury, close to a hundred people unfriended me on Facebook. Folks can\u2019t handle that I\u2019m a Trump supporter with immaculate taste.\u201d</p>, <p>Wintrich will be auctioning off art pieces at the event, with 30% of the proceeds going towards the American Military Partner Association.</p>, <p>\u201cWho knew that the way to be on the cutting edge of controversy in the art world would be to support Donald Trump?\u201d said <em>Breitbart</em>\u2019s Milo Yiannopoulos on the event. \u201cThe LBGT community\u2019s response to Lucian and his fellow artists is embarrassing. How can a movement dedicated to expression, pride and diversity be so dead set against diversity of opinion?\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cArt is one of those areas of culture that has been dominated by the left for decades, because the left used to represent the rebellious and the avant-garde. Now, of course, it represents the establishment, and its conservatives and Trump supporters who are the new renegades.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cI am proud to lend my artistic talents to Lucian\u2019s project along with many others in a personal statement of support for Donald Trump and making America great again.\u201d</p>, <p>You can <a href="/web/20161005062721/https://igg.me/at/daddywillsaveus">purchase tickets for Wintrich\u2019s #DaddyWillSaveUs event at IndieGoGo here</a>, and you can <a href="/web/20161005062721/http://www.daddywillsaveus.com/">check out the other special guests and more information about the event here</a>.</p>, <p>The full press release is copied below:</p>, <p><span style="font-size: medium;">\xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-size: medium;">\xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-size: medium;">\xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-size: medium;">\xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-size: medium;">\xa0</span></p>]
