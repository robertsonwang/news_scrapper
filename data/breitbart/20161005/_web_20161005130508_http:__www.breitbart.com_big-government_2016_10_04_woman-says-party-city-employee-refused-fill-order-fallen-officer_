[<p>Karly Lane told <a href="/web/20161005062623/http://www.wpxi.com/news/customer-says-party-store-employee-refused-to-fill-balloon-order-after-learning-its-for-officer/452827834">WPXI</a> that she went to Party City in Pleasant Hills to buy a dozen black and blue balloons for her friend Robert Gogo Jr., who died in a motorcycle accident in September.</p>, <p>Lane said she told the employee that the balloons were for a memorial ceremony for the fallen officer. That\u2019s when the employee allegedly told Lane that she refused to support a police officer and handed the task off to a coworker instead.</p>, <p>\u201cHow can you not support a police officer? It doesn\u2019t matter. They don\u2019t know my brother. They don\u2019t know what kind of man he was. They don\u2019t know what he did in his job. It just hurts,\u201d GoGo\u2019s sister Jennifer Martino told WPXI.</p>, <p>Lane posted an <a href="/web/20161005062623/https://www.facebook.com/karly.lane">update</a> to her Facebook page Tuesday saying that Party City\u2019s Chief Operating Officer would make two separate donations to the Duquesne Police Department in GoGo\u2019s name and in Party City\u2019s name.</p>, <p><iframe frameborder="0" height="332" scrolling="no" src="/web/20161005062623if_/https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fkarly.lane%2Fposts%2F10155214918384045&amp;width=500" width="500"></iframe></p>, <p>The manager of that Party City location said to WPXI that the store supported \u201call police officers\u201d and that corporate would release a statement on the matter.</p>, <p>\u201cParty City is committed to our customers and the community. Corporate management is looking into the matter to uncover what transpired and will take action accordingly,\u201d the company said.</p>, <p>This isn\u2019t the first time an employee of a customer service-oriented store has refused to service law enforcement.</p>, <p>In September, three Georgia Walmart employees <a href="/web/20161005062623/http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/09/25/georgia-walmart-workers-refuse-bake-officer-cake-retirement-party/">refused</a> to decorate a cake for a police officer\u2019s retirement party because they said it was \u201cracist.\u201d</p>]
