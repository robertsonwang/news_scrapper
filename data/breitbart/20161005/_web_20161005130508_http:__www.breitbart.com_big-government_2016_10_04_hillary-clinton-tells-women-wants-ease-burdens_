[<p>Actress Elizabeth Banks served as moderator for the Democrat nominee and her daughter Chelsea Clinton at a family town hall-style venue with many women and young people in the audience. The conversation generally focused on Clinton\u2019s plan to provide federal support for women who are struggling with low-paying jobs, with raising their children, and with gun violence in their neighborhoods. Clinton also said she empathizes with black mothers dealing with law enforcement targeting their children.</p>, <p>The former secretary of state said across America women are telling her they need help from the government to pay for their childcare so they can work. Clinton said the governments of so many other advanced countries provide more for women and that, as president, she would work to ensure the United States provides paid family leave and sick days as well.</p>, <p>\u201cIt should not be so hard to be a young parent,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd it should not be so hard on the other end of the age spectrum to take care of your loved one.\u201d</p>, <p>Banks said that, while on the campaign trail, Clinton describes these issues as \u201cquiet problems\u201d that tend to keep mothers up worrying at night. Clinton\xa0specifically mentioned problems with addictions and mental health issues in families.</p>, <p>\u201cPeople say, \u2018I can\u2019t get the help I need for myself, my spouse, my child,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s just not enough help.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cTwo-thirds of all minimum-wage earners are women,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd most of them have children.\u201d</p>, <p>Attempting to convey an image of herself as a woman other women want to confide in, Clinton said that while voters do ask her questions about \u201cwhat\u2019s in the headlines,\u201d they very often want to talk to her about \u201cwhat keeps them up at night.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cWomen tell me these stories about how hard it is,\u201d she continued. \u201cThey tell me not only do they have no paid family leave, they have no earned sick days.\u201d</p>, <p>Clinton said the nurse who cared for Chelsea and her newborn in the hospital told her women come in to have babies on a Monday but then must return to work by Thursday or Friday of the same week, or else lose their jobs.</p>, <p>Clinton added that women have so many stresses on them \u2013 from affordable childcare to how to make college affordable.</p>, <p>\u201cAll of these are issues people have raised with me,\u201d she said, adding that, as president, she hopes to \u201cease some of that burden.\u201d</p>, <p>Banks asked Chelsea Clinton about her relationship with her mother, and Chelsea responded that she is \u201cfiercely proud\u201d of her and emphasized that her mother is the grandmother of her own two children.</p>, <p>\u201cI wish that people really understood that stronger together, that putting families and children first, isn\u2019t rhetorical for my mom,\u201d she said.</p>, <p>Chelsea said she is happy to travel and campaign for her mother, though she misses her daughter when she is on the road. She said she can travel with her infant son because she is \u201cbreastfeeding,\u201d and received a round of applause after she announced she is open about breastfeeding and that there is nothing wrong with it.</p>, <p>During the question and answer segment of the forum, one 15-year-old girl told Clinton she, like many girls her age, is concerned about \u201cbody image\u201d and has seen \u201cwith my own eyes the damage [Republican nominee] Donald Trump has done when he talks about women and how they look.\u201d The teen asked Clinton how she plans to \u201cundo some of that damage\u201d as the first female president.</p>, <p>\u201cI\u2019m so proud of you for asking that question!\u201d Clinton exclaimed to the teen, thanking her profusely and adding that, \u201cYoung women are getting messages from the media\u201d earlier that they should be more concerned with their appearance than their minds.</p>, <p>\u201cMy opponent insulted Miss Universe!\u201d Clinton laughed as she spoke. \u201cI mean how do you get more acclaimed than that? But it wasn\u2019t good enough.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cWe need to laugh at it. We need to refute it. We need to ignore it. We need to stand up to it,\u201d she said, calling for an end to women being bullied.</p>, <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not all gonna end up in Miss Universe, I hate to tell you,\u201d Clinton said, and added that women can be the best they can be in other ways, a statement that drew further applause.</p>, <p>\u201cLet\u2019s be proud of who we are, and let\u2019s support other women and girls and be proud of who they are,\u201d she urged to more applause.</p>, <p>A town commissioner asked Clinton how she would support education at the local level. Clinton responded she has \u201cthought a lot about\u201d what happens at the local level.</p>, <p>\u201cI want to be the best possible partner of local communities,\u201d Clinton said, recalling aloud how her husband, when he was president, started federal dollars flowing to communities for police training and rehabilitating school buildings.</p>, <p>One of Clinton\u2019s campaign methods has been to present herself as the \u201cmaternal federal government,\u201d swooping in to save the downtrodden from the nasty state governments that refuse to support local communities.</p>, <p>Painting the state legislatures as the enemies of local schools, particularly in inner cities, Clinton said many school districts are being \u201cstarved by state governments.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cIt takes a village, but the village has to be there for people,\u201d Clinton said, promising more federal spending in local governments.</p>, <p>Chelsea Clinton added that schools should receive more financial support for teaching \u201cpro-social\u201d and anti-bullying behavior.</p>, <p>When one young teen proudly told Clinton that she played the role of the Democrat nominee during a class debate and won against another student who played Donald Trump, Clinton congratulated her for winning the debate and said, \u201cThat\u2019s 2 and 0 now!\u201d</p>, <p>The young girl then asked Clinton to explain more about her plan for \u201cdebt-free college.\u201d</p>, <p>Clinton again slammed the state legislatures for choosing to build more prisons instead of providing more funding for universities so that students can reduce their loan debt.</p>, <p>\u201cThe more you invest in higher education, the more prepared the work force will be,\u201d Clinton said, promising to let the federal government take on a greater role in funding college.</p>, <p>Clinton also pushed her goal of achieving a National Service force of volunteers, much like a civilian National Reserve, and said that those who volunteer to serve will be granted student loan forgiveness.</p>, <p>Chelsea Clinton also said she hopes, as president, her mother will be able to bring about automatic voter registration when Americans turn 18 \u201cto encourage more participation\u201d in elections. Clinton said young people ask her continually about criminal justice reform, student loan debt, and climate change, and they should be able to automatically vote when they turn 18 for leaders who will do what\u2019s right on these issues.</p>, <p>With the emphasis still on mothers and children, Clinton and her daughter talked about the importance of federal investment in well-child care and pregnancy care, stating that more women are dying during pregnancy, labor, and immediately after childbirth. Clinton expressed concern about the lack of pre-natal care.</p>, <p>\u201cWe have to look at the whole life cycle,\u201d Clinton said, \u201cAnd I am committed to doing everything I can to keep the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) alive, and to improve the Affordable Care Act.\u201d</p>, <p>Ironically, what neither Clinton nor her daughter discussed is that one of the Democrat nominee\u2019s main supports is the abortion industry. If elected president, Clinton has promised to provide even greater funding to Planned Parenthood and to eliminate the Hyde Amendment \u2013 a federal provision that bars taxpayer funding of abortions. Clinton says she wants the Hyde Amendment repealed so that more low-income women can obtain abortions easily.</p>, <p>\u201cAn amazing conversation,\u201d Banks said to both Clintons at the end of the forum. Banks specifically thanked Hillary Clinton for fighting for children and families \u201cyour entire adult life.\u201d</p>]
