She had accompanied Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on his return to Iran in 1979 and later wrote a most revealing book about the country\u2019s economic inner-workings.</p>, <p>In the interview, Sciolino <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/tehran/interviews/sciolino.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1475678525122000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE0KhBANEUjadgQ3iN2_Y2FpT-08A" href="/web/20161005122715/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/tehran/interviews/sciolino.html">reported</a>, \u201cCorruption is endemic to Iran\u2026 I think it is a factor that an awful lot of the clerics have an economic stake in keeping the Islamic system the way it is\u2014not only in terms of a strong Islamic republic, but in terms of strong control of the economy by quasi-governmental foundations in which they, the clerics, have an awful lot of control. If you open things up, if you allow foreign investment, if you make it interesting for Europeans, Americans, Japanese to come in and invest their money, it\u2019s going to degrade this system, which does give preferential treatment to a few.\u201d</p>, <p>Sciolino explained these foundations, while supposedly accountable, in reality are not, as books are kept secret. She adds, \u201cThere were hundreds, probably thousands of privileged people who benefit from this system\u2026\u201d</p>, <p>In her book, Sciolino <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/tehran/inside/govt.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1475678525122000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFRSclv73nx4bEcpoyBk3BRcO5Pjw" href="/web/20161005122715/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/tehran/inside/govt.html">details</a> much of the corruption. She notes that Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei controls foundations operating hundreds of companies, accounting for about 40% of the country\u2019s economy.</p>, <p>The foundations were established soon after the Islamic Revolution toppled the shah, confiscating, \u201cbillions of dollars in assets of the former royal family, banks, and ordinary homeowners.\u201d Khamenei has since doled out wealth to other religious and non-religious leaders supporting him. Their wealth grows as the foundations are exempted from paying taxes.</p>, <p>Sciolino continues, \u201cTwo decades after the revolution, the foundations are among the\xa0biggest economic complexes in the Middle East\u2026 Most of them are the individual fiefs of powerful clerics, and their size crowds out smaller private competitors who might be more efficient, even as their corruption fuels resentment.\u201d</p>, <p>Iranian filmmaker and spokesman (abroad) for the opposition, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, has, unlike Obama, endeavored to focus the spotlight on the lavish lifestyle of the country\u2019s Supreme Leader.</p>, <p>Makhmalbaf <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://defence.pk/threads/ayatollah-khamenies-secret-luxurious-lifestyle.245092/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1475678525122000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE6bXzMpOefNMHQNHLjXPsq8hZmyA" href="/web/20161005122715/http://defence.pk/threads/ayatollah-khamenies-secret-luxurious-lifestyle.245092/">details</a> Khamenei\u2019s enormous wealth, estimated at $30 billion (exclusive of an additional $6 billion for his family members) in cash, stocks, various real estate holdings (including a horse farm), foreign bank accounts, diamonds, etc.\u2014all this while also living in many of the late shah\u2019s villas.</p>, <p>And, Makhmalbaf claims, although not as great as Khamenei\u2019s wealth, many others similarly have joined the ranks of the \u201crich and famous\u201d mullahs accumulating hundreds of millions of dollars in state assets.</p>, <p>Not bad for clerics who earlier rode into town on donkeys!</p>, <p>As most Iranians struggle for daily existence, the mullahs continue adding to their personal wealth. Ironically, what supposedly is one of Islam\u2019s greatest strengths\u2014cleaning up corruption\u2014is used by Iranian clerics to join the ranks of the world\u2019s wealthiest people. They are accumulating, dare it be said, more money than Allah!</p>, <p>The word \u201cmullah\u201d means an educated Muslim trained in Islamic laws and doctrine. As such, mullahs are to act as shepherds for Muslim flocks in need of spiritual guidance on how to live Quran-compliant lives. Unfortunately, in Iran, materiality trumps spirituality for mullahs embarked upon an unending quest for \u201cmoolah.\u201d</p>, <p><em>Lt. Colonel James G.
