[<p>Stating that it is not enough to crack down on illegal migration, President Zeman told the <em>Financial Times</em> that he wants to deport any illegal migrants who came to Europe during the migrant crisis for economic reasons rather than legitimately fleeing oppression in their home countries,\xa0<a href="/web/20161005144806/http://www.bild.de/politik/ausland/tschechien/milos-zeman-migranten-48100446.bild.html">reports</a>\xa0<em>Bild</em>.</p>, <p>\u201cOf course, I recognise the cruelty of the civil war in Syria, Iraq and so on, but we are not talking about these people, but of economic migrants,\u201d Mr. Zeman said.</p>, <p>Economic migrants are said to make up\xa0<a href="/web/20161005144806/http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/01/29/eu-border-agency-syrian-numbers-declining-economic-migration-exploding/">the bulk</a> of the wave of people, primarily young men, who have come to Europe over the last two years from North Africa and the Middle East.</p>, <p>The president\u2019s\xa0policies on mass migration are closely aligned with those of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\xe1n. The Czech leader recently showed support for the prime minister\u2019s recommendation to the European Union (EU) that migrants should not be allowed to progress through mainland Europe, but have their asylum claims processed elsewhere.</p>, <p>The Hungarian made the comments late <a href="/web/20161005144806/http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/09/24/hungarys-orban-create-giant-refugee-city-africa/">last month</a>, stating that he would like to see a \u201crefugee city\u201d on the Libyan coast. This, Mr. Orb\xe1n suggested, would allow the EU to conduct thorough background checks and root out Islamic State militants posing as asylum seekers.</p>, <p>Mr. Zeman also proposed that Greece could pay off its debt to the rest of the EU by allowing the bloc to use some of its islands\xa0to house migrants. \u201cGreece has a lot of uninhabited islands and a large external debt.\xa0So if you create hotspots on Greek islands it would\xa0be a way to pay off the debt,\u201d he said.</p>, <p>The Czech leader said he is\xa0not against all forms of migration stating: \u201cI am not against immigrants in my country, who come from Ukraine, Vietnam, Russia, Belarus, Serbia and so on.\u201d The problem, Mr. Zeman\xa0notes, is mass Muslim migration.</p>, <p>\u201cI think that this culture is totally incompatible. Just one example: The behavior of Islamic migrants towards women. This is very different from our culture,\u201d he said.</p>, <p>The <a href="/web/20161005144806/http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/10/03/orban-eu-cannot-force-hungary-accept-migrants/">referendum victory </a>of fellow Visegrad Four leader Viktor Orb\xe1n will likely only embolden other leaders within the group to continue to resist the migrant policies of Western\xa0European leaders like German Chancellor Angela Merkel.</p>, <p>President Zeman has even discussed\xa0enlarging\xa0the Visegrad group when he <a href="/web/20161005144806/http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/09/09/czech-president-ally-norbert-hofer/">invited</a>\xa0Austrian presidential candidate for the Freedom Party (FP\xd6) Norbert Hofer, both expressing interest in Austria becoming a member.</p>]
