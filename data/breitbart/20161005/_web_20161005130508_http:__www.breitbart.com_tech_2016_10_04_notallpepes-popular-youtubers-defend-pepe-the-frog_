This means that Pepe now shares a home with the swastika, the confederate flag, white power pride.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cThe problem is, Pepe is not a symbol of hate. Pepe is a symbol of joy, of happiness, of friendship,\u201d they continued, before listing a variety of modified Pepe the Frog memes. \u201cYou and I cannot let reckless politicians abuse our innocent memes. Pepe deserves better. And with your help, we can clear Pepe\u2019s name, and make him happy for once.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cTweet #NotAllPepes,\u201d they encouraged. \u201cAnd together we can make the world a little greener.\u201d</p>, <p>The video ends with a song criticizing Hillary Clinton for branding Pepe the Frog a white supremacist icon, and <a href="/web/20161005140608/https://twitter.com/search?q=%23notallpepes&amp;src=typd">numerous Twitter users have since gone on to tweet under the #NotAllPepes hashtag</a>.</p>, <p>Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign <a href="/web/20161005140608/http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/09/14/clinton-campaign-pepe-frog-symbol-white-supremacy/">branded the cartoon frog a \u201csymbol of white supremacy,\u201d</a>\xa0basing their claims on\xa0<a href="/web/20161005140608/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/05/26/how-pepe-the-frog-became-a-nazi-trump-supporter-and-alt-right-symbol.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a Daily Beast interview with two notorious trolls</a>\xa0who have since mocked the author for falling for their claims.</p>, <p>Clinton\u2019s claims have since been echoed by <a href="/web/20161005140608/http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/09/16/george-stephanopoulos-pepe-frog-well-known-symbol-white-supremacist-movement/">ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos</a>, <a href="/web/20161005140608/http://www.breitbart.com/milo/2016/09/16/nbcs-katy-tur-accuses-milo-of-being-a-white-supremacist-icon/">NBC\u2019s Katy Tur</a>,\xa0<a href="/web/20161005140608/http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/09/19/heat-street-attacks-pepe-the-frog-agrees-with-clinton/">Heat Street\u2019s Louise Mensch and Ian Miles Cheong</a>, and <a href="/web/20161005140608/http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/09/27/adl-adds-pepe-the-frog-meme-to-hate-symbol-database/">even the Anti-Defamation League, who added the cartoon frog into their Hate Symbol Database</a>\xa0alongside the Nazi swastika, the burning cross, and the Ku Klux Klan logo.</p>, <p>Fans of Pepe the Frog <a href="/web/20161005140608/http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/09/30/war-memes-adl-pepe-backlash/">have since rebelled against the mislabeling online, branding it a War on Memes</a>, with <a href="/web/20161005140608/https://twitter.com/PhillyD/status/781212311520354309?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">SourceFed founder and popular YouTuber Philip DeFranco even joining in</a>.</p>, <p>\u201cI just think this is all a product of our insane political season,\u201d Anthony Fantano told\xa0Breitbart Tech, before blaming Pepe\u2019s recent branding on notorious troll @JaredTSwift.</p>, <p class="TweetTextSize js-tweet-text tweet-text" lang="">\u201cThis is the guy the Hillary Pepe explainer labeled as \u2018a prominent white supremacist\u2019 when he\u2019s literally just an internet troll whose ilk are associating Pepe with right-wing imagery in order to take Pepe out of the mainstream and make him a more authentic, underground meme,\u201d he explained.</p>, <p class="TweetTextSize js-tweet-text tweet-text" lang="">\u201cNot a mission I agree with, because that\u2019s not really how memes work, but those on the left who are taking the bait don\u2019t seem to get it either,\u201d he continued. \u201cA cartoon frog that\u2019s been shared countless times on the Internet for years and years cannot suddenly become a symbol of hate. Especially not with the trolls actively \u2018rebranding\u2019 the meme are so few in number.\u201d</p>, <p class="TweetTextSize js-tweet-text tweet-text" lang="">\u201cHowever, now that the mainstream media is selling this narrative that Pepe is racist, more people are jumping on the bandwagon because Pepe being a symbol of white nationalism is now becoming a meme itself,\u201d Fantano claimed. \u201cThis was basically just the spark of a dumb idea being doused in gasoline by the left\u2019s never-ending search for anything they can label as \u2018racist.'\u201d</p>, <p class="TweetTextSize js-tweet-text tweet-text" lang="">\u201cAnd since there had previously been associations between Trump and Pepe, that gave them reason to take this edgy internet trolling seriously,\u201d he concluded.\xa0\u201cIt was another opportunity to link Trump to bigots.\u201d</p>, <p><i>Charlie Nash is a reporter\xa0for\xa0Breitbart Tech.
