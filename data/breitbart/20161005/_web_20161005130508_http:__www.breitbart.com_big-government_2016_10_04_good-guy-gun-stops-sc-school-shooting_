[<p>The good guy was volunteer firefighter Jamie Brock, who was at a \u201cnearby farm\u201d when he heard reports of the shooting. Armed, he raced to the school and \u201cconfronted Jesse Osborne,\u201d the 14-year-old accused of killing his father then going to the school and shooting two 6-year-old boys and a teacher. One of the boys\u2013Jacob Hall\u2013died from his wounds on Saturday.</p>, <p><a href="/web/20161005074200/http://www.wyff4.com/news/firefighter-was-armed-during-takedown-of-shooting-suspect-sheriff-says/41938538">WYFF</a> reports that Brock reached \u201cthe elementary school moments before other officers could respond to a 911 call.\u201d Fire Chief\xa0Billy McAdams accompanied Brock and told reporters that Brock \u201ctook the shooter down.\u201d But McAdams did not mention that Brock had a gun. It has since been confirmed that he did.</p>, <p>There is no confirmation on how Brock utilized the firearm\u2013whether he fired at Osborne, held Osborne at gunpoint, or simply had his hand on the handle of the holstered gun to show he was ready to draw if the attack did not end. Either way, Brock ended the attack.</p>, <p>Brock released a statement on the incident, saying:</p>, <p>The true heroes of (the) senseless tragedy are the teachers that put their lives on the line to protect their students and the principal who through fears of her own did what\u2019s right to ensure the safety of the school.\xa0 They deserve to be called heroes, and to them I tip my hat.</p>, <p><em>AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
