[<p>The 50-year-old <em>Meet the Parents</em> star <a href="/web/20161005125736/https://www.howardstern.com/show/2016/10/4/ben-stiller-goes-public-how-he-fought-prostate-cancer-and-won/" target="_blank">told Stern</a> he was diagnosed with an \u201cintermediately aggressive\u201d form of the illness in 2014, when he was 48 years old, and that the news had come \u201cout of the blue.\u201d</p>, <p>Stiller appeared on Howard Stern\u2019s SiriusXM radio show alongside his surgeon, Dr. Edward Schaeffer, who had conducted a \u201crobotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy\u201d to successfully remove the actor\u2019s tumor. Stiller said that if he hadn\u2019t been receiving a regular test called a PSA test to screen for the deadly cancer, he may never have caught it in time.</p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="557" src="/web/20161005125736if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/VXBRonwTbqM?feature=oembed" width="990"></iframe></p>, <p>Stiller followed up his appearance on Howard Stern\u2019s show with an <a href="/web/20161005125736/https://medium.com/@RedHourBen/the-prostate-cancer-test-that-saved-my-life-613feb3f7c00#.9xe8oba7b" target="_blank">essay posted to Medium</a> about his experience.</p>, <p>\u201cI got diagnosed with prostate cancer Friday, June 13th, 2014. On September 17th of that year I got a test back telling me I was cancer free,\u201d Stiller wrote. \u201cThe three months in between were a crazy roller coaster ride with which about 180,000 men a year in America can identify.\u201d</p>, <p>He continued:</p>, <p>\u201cTaking the PSA test saved my life. Literally. That\u2019s why I am writing this now. There has been a lot of controversy over the test in the last few years. Articles and op-eds on whether it is safe, studies that seem to be interpreted in many different ways, and debates about whether men should take it all. I am not offering a scientific point of view here, just a personal one, based on my experience. The bottom line for me: I was lucky enough to have a doctor who gave me what they call a \u201cbaseline\u201d PSA test when I was about 46. I have no history of prostate cancer in my family and I am not in the high-risk group, being neither\u200a\u2014\u200ato the best of my knowledge\u200a\u2014\u200aof African or Scandinavian ancestry. I had no symptoms.\u201d</p>, <p>The actor praised the \u201cthoughtful\u201d internist who conducted PSA tests on him, avoiding guidelines set forth by by the American Cancer Society to wait until age 50 to conduct them. The actor wrote that critics of the test contend that,\xa0\u201cdepending on how they interpret the data, doctors can send patients for further tests like the MRI and the more invasive biopsy, when not needed.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cBut without this PSA test itself, or any screening procedure at all, how are doctors going to detect asymptomatic cases like mine, before the cancer has spread and metastasized throughout one\u2019s body rendering it incurable?\u201d Stiller wrote.</p>, <p>Stiller\xa0concluded by revealing that he has now been cancer-free for two years. The actor and filmmaker has a number of projects coming up, both in front of and behind the camera, including a starring role opposite Adam Sandler and Dustin Hoffman in Noah Baumbach\u2019s next movie and as a producer on <em>Dodgeball 2</em> and Jack Black comedy <em>The Polka King</em>.</p>, <p>\xa0</p>, <p><em>Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: <a href="/web/20161005125736/https://twitter.com/dznussbaum" target="_blank">@dznussbaum</a></em></p>]
