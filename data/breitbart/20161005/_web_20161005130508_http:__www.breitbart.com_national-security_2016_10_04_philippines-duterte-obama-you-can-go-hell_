[<p>Duterte, who had <a href="/web/20161005193916/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/06/07/duterte-boycotts-media/">vowed</a> as president-elect not to give any statements to the media, made the statements during his second public appearance on Tuesday. He insulted both President Obama and the EU as a response to the growing concern in the West that Duterte\u2019s war on drugs is enabling extrajudicial killings and human rights abuses.</p>, <p>Duterte defended his war on drugs from criticism.\xa0\u201cAlthough it may sound shit to you, it is my sacred duty to keep the integrity of this republic and the people healthy,\u201d\xa0<a href="/web/20161005193916/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/Philippine-leader-Duterte-tells-Obama-go-to-hell-says-can-buy-arms-from-Russia-China/articleshow/54677513.cms">he said</a>.</p>, <p>\u201cInstead of helping us, the first to hit was the State Department.

Hell is full already. Why should I be afraid of you?\u201d</p>, <p>Duterte said he is not afraid of an arms sales ban from the West because he can look to Russia: \u201cI\u2019ll go to Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cThey said, \u2018Just come over and sign and everything will be delivered.'\u201d</p>, <p>Reuters describes American officials as increasingly frustrated with Duterte, who took office in June, and are \u201cdoing [their] best to ignore Duterte\u2019s rhetoric and not provide him with a pretext for more outbursts.\u201d Duterte has referred to President Obama as a \u201c<a href="/web/20161005193916/http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/09/06/obama-cancels-meeting-philippines-president-son-whore-comment/">son of a whore</a>\u201d and U.S. Ambassador to Manila Philip Goldberg as an \u201c<a href="/web/20161005193916/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/08/08/rodrigo-duterte-u-s-ambassador-annoying-homosexual-son-btch/">annoying \u2026 homosexual</a>.\u201d Concerning\xa0Secretary of State John Kerry, Duterte has said he is \u201cokay.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cIn as much as our alliance with the Philippines is concerned, it\u2019s very much solid and stable and secure and on track,\u201d Pentagon spokesperson Jeff Davis <a href="/web/20161005193916/http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/10/04/1630254/us-dismisses-dutertes-edca-statement">said on Tuesday</a>.</p>, <p>Duterte\u2019s most recent insults come as the U.S. and Philippines begin their annual joint military exercises, and they follow a speech in which Duterte vowed to end these exercises and \u201c<a href="/web/20161005193916/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/10/03/duterte-putin-xi-close-friends/">make friends</a>\u201d with China and Russia instead.\xa0\u201cI told [Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev]\xa0I\u2019m about to cross the Rubicon between me and the United States at least for the six years,\u201d he said in a <a href="/web/20161005193916/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/09/27/duterte-cozies-china/">speech in September</a>, without elaborating.</p>, <p>Just as American officials say the bond between the two nations is strong, so, too, have Philippine military officials deviated from the belligerent tone their president has set.\xa0\u201cWith commitment from our marine forces, we have continuously kept our goal to sustain good relationship and cooperation thereby upgrading each other\u2019s capabilities and competencies,\u201d Philippine Marine Corps Commandant Maj. Gen.

He insists these military exercises will not be the last, telling reporters of Duterte\u2019s comments, \u201c<a href="/web/20161005193916/http://www.rappler.com/nation/147649-yasay-denies-duterte-last-military-exercise-united-states">No, no, no, he did not say that at all</a>.\u201d Yasay has <a href="/web/20161005193916/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/08/22/spokesman-duterte-hungry-said-philippines-leave-un/">previously had to excuse</a> Duterte\u2019s inappropriate remarks by telling reporters that the president was \u201chungry\u201d at the time.</p>, <p>Yasay went further than presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella, who refused to answer press questions about Duterte\u2019s latest attack on the U.S., calling the matter \u201c<a href="/web/20161005193916/http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/10/04/1630282/palace-mum-edca-conflicting-statements">beyond my paycheck</a>.\u201d</p>, <p>Duterte <a href="/web/20161005193916/http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/10/04/1630442/duterte-never-mind-my-mouth">excused his own comments</a> in a separate public event on Tuesday by arguing he was \u201cnot ready for the big league.\u201d He added,\xa0shrugging, \u201cI can only act like a mayor\u201d and \u201cI never aspired to be a statesman.\u201d</p>, <p>In that event, a forum with local officials, Duterte went on to explain why\xa0he was single: \u201cIf I court someone, will they reciprocate my feelings? Nobody will, I\u2019m old. I\u2019m 71.\u201d Apparently remarking on his own virility, he lamented,\xa0\u201cPeople of our age only have the western train of the cowboys. \u2026 It does not work anymore.\u201d</p>, <p>Getting back on track, Duterte asserted, \u201cThere is no law which says I cannot threaten criminals either as a mayor or president. If anyone disagrees, give me the provision or law.\u201d</p>, <p>During\xa0the past weekend,\xa0Duterte apologized\xa0to the global Jewish community for <a href="/web/20161005193916/http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/02/philippines-duterte-apologizes-jews-hitler-comparison/">comparing himself favorably to Adolf Hitler</a> in a speech in which he said he would \u201chappily slaughter\u201d three million people.</p>]
