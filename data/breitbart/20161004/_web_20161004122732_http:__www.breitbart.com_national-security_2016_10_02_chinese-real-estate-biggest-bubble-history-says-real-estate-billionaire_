[<p>\u201cI don\u2019t see a good solution to this problem. The government has come up with all sorts of measures \u2013 limiting purchase or credit \u2013 but none have worked,\u201d Wang warned.</p>, <p>His own investment group has been shifting resources away from real estate, and into entertainment, sports, and tourism \u2014 prominently including the acquisition of Hollywood studio Legendary Entertainment, movie theater chain Carmike Cinemas, and possibly soon Dick Clark Productions. CNN notes his big dream is to buy one of the \u201cBig Six\u201d movie studios, like 20th Century Fox or Universal Pictures.</p>, <p>The problem with China\u2019s real estate, as Wang sees it, is that too many properties in smaller cities are unoccupied, while big-city prices skyrocket, creating a great deal of consumer debt \u2014 about $3.6 trillion in U.S. dollars. He thinks the Chinese economy is still too weak from last year\u2019s stock market crash to deal with the debt bubble.</p>, <p>\u201cChina has a love-hate relationship with the real estate market. Recently it tried to cool the overheated market in large cities with restrictions on home sales, even punishing property agents who hype the market,\u201d\xa0<em><a href="/web/20161004155111/http://www.businessinsider.com/chinas-richest-man-chinese-real-estate-biggest-bubble-in-history-2016-9">Business Insider</a>\xa0</em>reports. \u201cStill, the government\u2019s efforts haven\u2019t slowed the market much, with property sales growing 31.8% in August compared to a year ago.\u201d</p>, <p>Back in April,\xa0<em><a href="/web/20161004155111/http://www.forbes.com/sites/wadeshepard/2016/04/05/why-chinas-housing-market-refuses-to-crash/#4a1b694b720b">Forbes</a>\xa0</em>hypothesized that the Chinese housing bubble hasn\u2019t burst because the government maintains such tight controls over the market, using everything from regulations to interest rates to manipulate construction and real estate sales.</p>, <p>A critical feature of the Chinese market is that \u201cthe conditions which caused the U.S. housing crash in 2008 simply don\u2019t exist in China, as things like sub-prime mortgages and mortgage backed securities are either prohibited, or are otherwise not very widespread.\u201d</p>, <p>That is because Chinese home buyers must make enormous down payments \u2014 30 percent for a first home, up to 50 percent for a second, and it can be even higher when the government wants to cool the housing market down. Qualifying for a loan can be very difficult. In fact, citizens are actually classified as \u201chome buyers\u201d or \u201cnon-buyers,\u201d and only by meeting certain conditions, such as paying income tax in a particular area for several years, can a \u201cnon-buyer\u201d become a \u201cbuyer.\u201d</p>, <p>It is interesting that the American Left, which so resolutely admires Chinese authoritarianism in many other social and economic spheres, remains wedded to the idea that \u201csocial justice\u201d equals easy loans, and increasing home ownership will conjure prosperity from thin air.</p>, <p>At any rate, Wang would seem to disagree with\xa0<em>Forbes\u2019s\xa0</em>contention that the Chinese market is immune to bubble-popping, or at least cushioned against the effects. The Chinese stock market crash was supposed to be impossible, too.</p>]
