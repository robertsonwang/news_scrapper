[<p>The Chicago-based <a href="/web/20161004170936/http://www.indiewire.com/t/fnd-films/">FND Films</a> comedy troupe that including Aaron Fronk, Vinny DeGaetano and Cooper Johnson created an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign in 2014 for their first film. They had hoped to raise $72,000, but actually pocketed over $77,000.</p>, <p>But then the crew took the money and disappeared without ever giving the donors any updates on the movie or their fate. But in mid-September, FND Films went on YouTube to <a href="/web/20161004170936/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6giJMG8Oe3E&amp;feature=youtu.be">post a video</a> apologizing that due to \u201ccomplications and elements\xa0beyond their control\u201d, the movie could not be completed. The complications seemed to be FND partying.</p>, <p>The video apology caused lots of outrage, until FND Films acknowledged that the \u201creal\u201d movie plot for \u201cIt\u2019s All Good\u201d is a comedy about their own wacky venture as millennial losers that teamed to <a href="/web/20161004170936/https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/it-s-all-good-by-fnd-films#/">raise $77k on Indiegogo</a>, but blew most of the cash on cocaine, limousines, champagne, and hookers. They claim they finally had to actually make the film\xa0because some of their unsavory donors got rough and forced them to finish the flick.</p>, <p>FND President Fronk <a href="/web/20161004170936/http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/q-and-a/a49026/fnd-films-indiegogo-its-all-good/">told</a> Esquire the prank was planned from the start and it was\xa0very stressful to keep the plot secret for two and a half years. \u201cWe felt this was a unique move, something that had the potential to get big, so we ran with it,\u201d Fronk added:</p>, <p>\u201cThe whole thing has been a tricky process\u2014we were constantly worried about blowing it. We needed a catalyst for why the money was gone, but you have to ride the line where it\u2019s a believable scenario\u2013Lying to people for two and a half years is rough\u2014we\u2019ve had to take a hit in our careers because we wanted to make it look like we disappeared. We couldn\u2019t tell certain actors in the film what the movie was about, and you\u2019ve got these people who donated thousands of dollars based on the most vague pitch that you can\u2019t clue them in. I\u2019ve so badly wanted to say, \u2018No no no, it\u2019s just a joke.\u2019\u201d</p>, <p>As the first crowdfunding, the real Indiegogo reports that they have more than 2.5 million people from 226 countries and territories that made over $800 million in cash commitments for 175,479 deals they call \u201ccreative, entrepreneurial and cause-related projects.\u201d</p>, <p>Although many crowdfunded deals have gone on to actually make products and services, Indiegogo <a href="/web/20161004170936/https://go.indiegogo.com/blog/2015/12/2015-crowdfunding-infographic-statistics-tech-film-social.html">reports</a> only a couple have gone on to attract venture capital. Like all business start-ups, a huge number of Indiegogo deals end up having low to no return for their donors.</p>, <p>The \u201c<a href="/web/20161004170936/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNdaEY4iMJU">It\u2019s All Good</a>\u201d trailer announcing an October 21 release is truly hilarious. It also seems that it will be easy for FND Films to leverage the story line into a great cable comedy series about how dumb and crooked crowdfunders squander their donors\u2019 cash in \u201ccreative, entrepreneurial and cause-related\u201d partying.</p>]
