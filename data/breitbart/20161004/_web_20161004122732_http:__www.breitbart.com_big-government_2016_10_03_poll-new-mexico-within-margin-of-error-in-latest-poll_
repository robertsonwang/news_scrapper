[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The survey, <a href="/web/20161004165921/https://www.abqjournal.com/857961/clinton-trump-in-tight-race-in-new-mexico.html" target="_blank">from the Albuquerque Journal</a>, shows Clinton leading Trump 35 percent to 31 percent, with the state\u2019s former governor Libertarian Gary Johnson pulling 24 percent and two percent for Green Party candidate Dr. Jill Stein just over a month from election day.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">The poll of 501 likely New Mexico voters, conducted from Sept. 27 to Sept. 29, has a margin of error of 4.4 percent. That means Trump is statistically tied with Clinton in a state that hasn\u2019t gone Republican since 2004 when incumbent GOP president George W. Bush eked out a victory there over Democratic candidate John Kerry. T</span><span class="s1">he last time the state went more than 50 percent for a Republican was in 1988 when George H.W. Bush won nearly 52 percent of the vote there. Ronald Reagan, in both 1980 and 1984 in his reelection, won the state comfortably with nearly 55 percent of the vote the first time and nearly 60 percent the next time.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Trump is about to hit the road out west with a swing through Colorado on Monday along with stops down in Arizona and Nevada over the coming days. Campaign sources tell Breitbart News he is considering adding a New Mexico campaign stop on his western surge trip, and recent <a href="/web/20161004165921/http://nmpoliticalreport.com/95135/trump-campaign-to-air-ads-in-new-mexico/" target="_blank">reports have surfaced</a> that the Trump campaign is actively spending in New Mexico.\xa0</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Research &amp; Polling, Inc., president Brian Sanderoff tells the Albuquerque Journal,\xa0</span><span class="s1">\u201cThe bottom line is that New Mexico is more competitive than I expected.\u201d</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">What\u2019s more, this poll confirms that the third party candidates\u2014Johnson and Stein\u2014are pulling more from Clinton than they are from Trump.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">\u201cWhen the third-party candidates \u2013 Johnson and Stein \u2013 were removed from the Journal poll and voters were asked who they preferred in a head-to-head matchup between Trump and Clinton, Clinton\u2019s lead increased from four points to 10 points,\u201d the Albuquerque Journal wrote. \u201cForty-four percent of likely New Mexico voters voiced a preference for Clinton compared to 34 percent who favored Trump when the polling question included only those two candidates.\u201d</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hispanic voters don\u2019t like Clinton, and are gravitating in large part toward Johnson. That, in turn, hurts the Democratic nominee, Sanderoff says.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">\u201cJohnson is picking up Hispanic support, and that is what is keeping Hillary Clinton down,\u201d he said.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Clinton doesn\u2019t even hit 50 percent with Hispanics.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">\u201cStill, Clinton holds a solid lead over Trump among Hispanics in New Mexico, according to the poll. Forty percent of Hispanics said they would vote for Clinton while 18 percent said they would vote for Trump. Stein polled at zero percent support among Hispanics in New Mexico,\u201d the newspaper wrote. \u201cSanderoff said Clinton needs more support among Hispanics to count on victory in New Mexico.\u201d</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sanderoff said that Clinton\u2019s horrendous showing with Hispanic voters in New Mexico is tearing her down.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">\u201cThe Democratic candidate needs to be getting much more than 40 percent of the Hispanic vote to win New Mexico comfortably,\u201d he said.</span></p>, <p class="p1" style="text-align: left;"><span class="s1">As Breitbart News <a href="/web/20161004165921/http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/09/26/analysis-donald-trump-would-win-election-today-based-current-polling/" target="_blank">has already reported</a>, assuming Trump can keep Georgia and Arizona locked in, his polling lead in several other states\u2014Florida, Ohio, Nevada, Iowa, Maine\u2019s second congressional district and now Colorado\u2014would put him at 275 electoral votes. Now that states like New Mexico and Minnesota\u2014where a recent Breitbart News Network/Gravis Marketing survey showed Clinton and Trump tied\u2014are in play, Trump\u2019s pathway to the White House is widening even more. He\u2019s competitive in places like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, Virginia, statewide in Maine, and has had strong showing in recent surveys in places like Rhode Island and Vermont.\xa0</span></p>]
