[<p>Clinton now leads Donald Trump 46% \u2013 41% in Florida according to this poll, breaking out of a 43%-43% tie in Quinnipiac\u2019s September survey.</p>, <p>However, Trump\xa0<em>increased\xa0</em>his lead in Ohio. He\u2019s now leading 47%-42%, a slight improvement over his 41%-37% lead in September.</p>, <p>Meanwhile, the poll shows Clinton leading 46%-43% in North Carolina and 45%-41% in Pennsylvania. Both of these leads are within the poll\u2019s margin of error.</p>, <p>Quinnipiac analysts found North Carolina \u201ctoo close to call,\u201d because Clinton and Trump were evenly matched in support from their parties, independent voters, and their respective sides of the \u201cgender gap.\u201d</p>, <p>Pennsylvania was seen as a \u201cslightly-to-close-to-be-comfortable lead\u201d for Clinton\u2014especially worrisome since poll respondents thought she won the debate by a huge 57%-21% margin.</p>, <p>\u201cWith neighboring Ohio leaning to Donald Trump, critical Pennsylvania stays true to Clinton who barely holds her ground from her pre-debate numbers,\u201d said assistant poll director Tim Malloy.</p>, <p>It should be noted that all of these topline results\xa0included Libertarian Gary Johnson and Jill Stein of the Green Party, except for North Carolina, where Stein is not on the ballot. Perhaps for that reason, North Carolina was Johnson\u2019s best showing, at 7%.</p>, <p>In a two way race, Clinton leads in Florida by 49%-44%, in North Carolina by 49-46%, and in Pennsylvania by 48%-43%, while Trump leads Ohio by 49%-46%.</p>]
