[<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how he\u2019s a candidate, he is so dangerous, and what he brings to my country, what he\u2019s awakened in my country, is bigotry and distrust and a certain kind of supremacy in certain groups, and he lies,\u201d Cher said of the Republican\xa0presidential nominee.</p>, <p>\u201cHe\u2019s amazing, he tells something and then you go back and see what he\u2019s said and it seems like the truth both times, he\u2019s so terrific at lying,\u201d the singer added. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anyone so good, it\u2019s amazing. I could go on and on on this subject forever because I\u2019m so traumatized by him. I am truly traumatized by him.\u201d</p>, <p>Cher, however, saved her\xa0more sobering\xa0criticisms for Clinton.</p>, <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not easy, because especially millennials\u2014they\u2019re not drawn to Hillary; they don\u2019t trust her, they feel that her sins are really enormous,\u201d Cher <a href="/web/20161004061015/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-3816730/Im-traumatised-Trump-says-Cher-warning-election-change-America.html" target="_blank">said</a> according to the <em>Daily Mail</em>.</p>, <p>\u201cIf you delve into some of the things she\u2019s being accused of\u2014she\u2019s screwed up and that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="743" src="/web/20161004061015if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/QlfrUuxrPjY?feature=oembed" width="990"></iframe></p>, <p>According to <a href="/web/20161004061015/http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/30/politics/hillary-clinton-millennials-north-carolina/" target="_blank">CNN</a>, \u201cClinton is under-performing with millennials.\u201d</p>, <p>The Oscar-winning actress, did, however, suggest that Clinton would \u201cdo her best\u201d\xa0should she win in\xa0November.</p>, <p>\u201cBut I\u2019ve known her for a long time and I think that she will do her best. And she\u2019s a politician but she will do her best. If you look at her from the beginning of her life till now, she\u2019s worked hard for people.\u201d</p>, <p>Cher\u2019s commentary at the humanitarian-focused confab was meant to spotlight her various animal right efforts. But the singer\u2019s remarks constantly veered into\xa0presidential politics.</p>, <p>Warning millennial voters, Cher said, \u201cThey need to know is that this election will change America and have consequences for the world for 40 years and the people who will suffer the most are millennials.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cAnd they will suffer because the people he will bring with him will put an end to any hope that women have of getting the rights we had in Roe v Wade. I believe they will put an end to any gay marriage. They will put an end to gay adoption. They will put an end to so many services that we do for the old, the young, the starving,\u201d she added.</p>, <p>Cher continued: \u201cI would say that it has such far-reaching consequences and\u2014look, it\u2019s not going to hurt me, I\u2019m 70, it\u2019s not going to do anything to me\u2014it\u2019s going to do stuff to young people and that really scares me and it bothers me.\u201d</p>, <p>Not known to shy\xa0away from sharing her thoughts on Trump\u2019s political rise, Cher called the real estate magnate a\xa0\u201cf*cking idiot\u201d and compare Trump to Hitler\xa0during a\xa0<a href="/web/20161004061015/http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2016/08/22/cher-hosts-clinton-fundraiser-hill-gave-great-speech/" target="_blank">fundraiser</a>\xa0for Clinton in August.</p>, <p>During the animal rights-centered event in Canada, Cher also turned her ire\xa0toward Trump\u2019s son\u2019s, Donald Trump, Jr., and Eric Trump, who caused controversy after\xa0posting a <a href="/web/20161004061015/http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2016/09/02/madonna-attacks-donald-trumps-sons-for-hunting-wild-leopard/" target="_blank">photo</a> showing them celebrating the killing of a leopard they hunted during a trip to Africa.</p>, <p>\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s sons, there\u2019s a picture of them holding a dead leopard. And I think that when that kind of message is sent from people who are influential, it\u2019s the exact wrong message,\u201d Cher said. \u201cIt changes the mindset of people, they become numb to what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p>, <p><em>Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter:\xa0<a href="/web/20161004061015/https://twitter.com/JeromeEHudson" target="_blank">@JeromeEHudson</a></em></p>]
