He was referring to a photo of the deceased priest, which the Pope had signed.</p>, <p>In an extended reflection on Christian martyrdom, the Pope said in his homily that today there are \u201cmore Christian martyrs\u201d than in the early days of Christianity.</p>, <p>\u201cToday there are Christians murdered, tortured, imprisoned, slaughtered because they do not deny Jesus Christ,\u201d he said, and Father Jacques Hamel \u201cis part of this chain of martyrs.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cChristians who suffer today because they will not deny Jesus Christ\u2014whether in prison or by death or torture\u2014they show how cruel this persecution is,\u201d he said, adding that killing in the name of God is \u201csatanic.\u201d</p>, <p>Francis words seemed aimed particularly at the Islamic terrorists who kill in the name of jihad, and claim to be accomplishing the will of Allah.</p>, <p>Father Jacques Hamel \u201cwas slain on the Cross,\u201d Francis said, \u201cjust as he celebrated the sacrifice of the Cross of Christ.\u201d</p>, <p>This good, humble man, who was always trying to make peace, \u201cwas assassinated as if he were a criminal,\u201d Francis said. \u201cThis is the thread of satanic persecution.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cHe gave his life so as not to deny Jesus,\u201d the Pope said, while urging those present to ask for the saint\u2019s intercession, that from Heaven he might pray to God for the Church on earth.\u201d</p>, <p>Francis was accompanied at Mass by some 80 French pilgrims who came specifically for the celebration, including the slain priest\u2019s sister, Rosine Hamel.</p>, <p><em>Follow Thomas D.
