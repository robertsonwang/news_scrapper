[<p>Barbara Bush spent the night of October 1 rubbing elbows with Abedin in Paris, France, at a special Clinton fundraiser held during the City of Light\u2019s famed Paris Fashion Week. According to <a href="/web/20161004060521/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3817829/Another-Bush-Hillary-Barbara-Bush-spends-Saturday-night-Paris-partying-Huma-Abedin-Clinton-fundraiser.html"><em>The Daily Mail</em></a>, Bush\xa0\u201cpaid at least $5,000 for the privilege.\u201d</p>, <p>The party featured Abedin, Hollywood actress Dakota Fanning, and other celebrities.\xa0Black Eyed Peas band member Will.i.am also participated in events during the weekend geared at \u201cmobiliz[ing] the <a href="/web/20161004060521/http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/09/21/surprise-that-will-end-trump-globalists-registering-8-million/">expat vote</a>\xa0with just five weeks to go.\u201d</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text">Left to right: Huma Abedin, Derek Blasberg, Barbara Bush, actress Dakota Fanning, and hostess Lauren Santo Domingo (Instagram / @thelsd)</p>, <p>The special party was co-hosted by <i>Vogue</i> magazine\u2019s editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and concluded with a dinner at American socialite Lauren Santo Domingo\u2019s Paris home with tickets costing $5,000 per seat ($10,000 to \u201cco-host\u201d with \u201cpreferred seating\u201d).</p>, <p>Huma Abedin, Hillary\u2019s long-time top aide, has been in the news quite a bit lately. She was embarrassed yet again by the <a href="/web/20161004060521/http://www.breitbart.com/news/clinton-aide-abedin-dumps-husband-weiner-over-new-scandal/">sexual abuse allegations against her husband, Anthony Weiner</a>. The one-time Congressman is now <a href="/web/20161004060521/http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/09/21/nypd-anthony-weiner-sexting-minor/">under investigation</a> for soliciting sex from a 15-year-old girl. He was also condemned for allegedly\xa0<a href="/web/20161004060521/http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/08/29/again-anthony-weiner-deletes-twitter-after-embarrassing-clinton-campaign-with-more-racy-photos/">using his infant son</a> as a \u201cchick magnet\u201d to get women.</p>, <p>But more worrisome is Abedin\u2019s troubling involvement with Hillary\u2019s email scandal. During an FBI investigation, for instance, Abedin told agents she had no knowledge of Hillary\u2019s illegal email server yet released <a href="/web/20161004060521/http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/09/28/fbi-documents-huma-abedin-denied-knowledge-of-clinton-email-server-she-picked-hillarys-username/">documents suggests she lied</a> to the FBI.</p>, <p>Despite all these scandals, young Barbara Bush was seen mingling with Abedin and, according to <em>The Daily Mail</em>, shelling out big dollars for Hillary\u2019s campaign to do so.</p>, <p>Barbara is hardly the first Bush said to be refusing to support the duly nominated candidate for the Republican Party, Donald Trump, and supporting Clinton instead. Many were aghast when her grandfather, <a href="/web/20161004060521/http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/09/20/report-george-h-w-bush-vote-hillary-clinton/">former President George H.W. Bush</a>, was reported as telling a member of the Kennedy clan that he was voting for Hillary.</p>, <p>The former President is only one of the Bush clan seemingly acting the turncoat to his own party. H.W.\u2019s son, former Florida Governor and failed GOP presidential candidate, Jeb Bush, has also been on record as refusing to support his own party.</p>, <p>Even after Donald Trump essentially won the GOP nomination for president, for instance, Jeb petulantly insisted that <a href="/web/20161004060521/http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/05/06/bitter-jeb/">he would never vote for Trump</a>. And at the end of September, <a href="/web/20161004060521/http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/jeb-bush-not-voting-clinton-or-trump-would-send-message-n657191">Jeb reiterated his refusal to support the party</a> by insisting that Republicans should stay home in November because, in his estimation, not voting would make a \u201cpowerful political statement.\u201d</p>, <p>Jeb\u2019s super rich, establishment donors have followed their preferred candidate\u2019s lead, too. One Bush donor pledged to donate a whopping <a href="/web/20161004060521/http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/09/20/top-jeb-bush-donor-pledges-over-2-million-for-hillary-clintons-latino-outreach/">$2 million to Hillary\u2019s Latino outreach program</a> to help her get elected in November.</p>, <p>Still another Bush has also been reticent to support the party\u2019s nominee. Texas Land Commissioner and Texas GOP Victory Chair George P. Bush, Jeb\u2019s son, initially said <a href="/web/20161004060521/http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/06/13/trump-bushed-jebs-nephew-texas-gop-victory-chairman-wont-endorse/">he would never vote for Donald Trump</a>. But only a few months later it appears he softened his stance by saying <a href="/web/20161004060521/http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2016/08/08/george-p-bush-swallow-bitter-pill-vote-trump/">it is important to stop Hillary</a> so Republicans should \u201cswallow a bitter pill\u201d and vote Trump.</p>, <p>But not everyone in the Bush family orbit have turned against the Republican Party. Recently no less than 50 Bush appointees came out with <a href="/web/20161004060521/http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/09/26/50-former-bush-appointees-endorse-donald-trump/">a bold and forceful endorsement</a> of Donald Trump.</p>, <p><i>Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter <a href="/web/20161004060521/https://twitter.com/warnerthuston">@warnerthuston</a> or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com</i>.</p>]
