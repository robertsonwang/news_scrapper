At the time, her hips were still sore from a series of injections intended to calm her. She had gotten them in February, during a difficult time in her life, when she had been involuntarily hospitalized for several weeks after what she called a \u201crant,\u201d a series of online postings that included one saying that Obama should be hanged and the White House fumigated and burned to the ground. On her discharge papers, in a box labeled \u201cmedical problem,\u201d a doctor had typed \u201chomicidal ideation.\u201d</p>, <p>Melanie thought the whole thing was outrageous. She wasn\u2019t a person with homicidal ideation. She was anxious, sure. Enraged, definitely. But certainly not homicidal, and certainly not in need of a hospital stay.</p>, <p>\u201cIt never crossed my mind that I\u2019m losing it,\u201d she said several months after her release, and a big reason for this conviction was the rise of Donald Trump, who had talked about so many of the things she had come to believe \u2014 from Obama being a founder of the terrorist group ISIS, to Hillary Clinton being a co-founder, to the idea that U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia may have been murdered in a White House plot involving a prostitute and a pillow.</p>, <p>The woman\u2019s enthusiasm for Trump is recorded in detail:</p>, <p>\u201cHere comes Big Daddy,\u201d she said, clapping. \u201cThe Donald. Big Daddy.\u201d</p>, <p>Kevin was snoring.</p>, <p>\u201cHere he is, babe,\u201d she said. \u201cDonald\u2019s here, babe.\u201d</p>, <p>Trump walked onto the stage, chanting \u201cU-S-A! U-S-A!\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Donald \u2014 USA, baby,\u201d Melanie said to the Republican nominee for president, who began his speech by marveling at all the Americans who had gotten him here.</p>, <p>\u201cWho would have believed that when we started this journey on June 16th of last year we \u2014 and I say we, because we are a team \u2014 would have received almost 14 million votes?\u201d Trump said, looking out on the cheering crowd.</p>, <p>\u201cI would,\u201d Melanie said to the TV. \u201c<i>I</i> would, Donald.\u201d</p>, <p>The article closes with a very clear implication about the woman\u2019s \u201chead.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cYou winning?\u201d she said, but Kevin was drifting off again, and as Trump went on about \u201chow the system is rigged,\u201d and \u201cwounded American families\u201d and \u201cour own struggling citizens,\u201d Melanie said yes, yes, yes, over and over again, until Trump reached the final three words of his speech.</p>, <p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said.</p>, <p>\u201cHe really does love us,\u201d Melanie said, and soon, the balloons were dropping, Trump was waving to the crowd, and she was switching off the television. She didn\u2019t need to hear any more.</p>, <p>\u201cIt\u2019s finished,\u201d she said of the 2016 presidential election, in which she was sure Trump would triumph and more and more people across the country would at last see the truth. \u201cIn my head, anyway.\u201d</p>]
