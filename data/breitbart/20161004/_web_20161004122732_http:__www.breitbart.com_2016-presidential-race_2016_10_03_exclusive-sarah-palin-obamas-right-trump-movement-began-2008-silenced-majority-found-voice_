[<p>In an email statement to Breitbart News, Palin wrote:</p>, <p>There\u2019s a reason pro-American activists have been living rent free in President Obama\u2019s head these past eight years. Some may feel guilty about the running tab, but I\u2019ll just add it to his doubling of the national debt to $20 trillion. This far-left administration is the overseer of a piled-on $200 trillion unfunded liabilities bill that\u2019s destroying our children\u2019s future, and <em>that\u2019s</em> what should occupy the President\u2019s headspace, not some hockey mom from Alaska. He\u2019s right though \u2014 the rise of the Trump movement began in 2008 when the \u201csilenced majority\u201d that\u2019s been trampled on by both parties rose up, found their voice, and uses it mightily today.</p>, <p>In <a href="/web/20161004170900/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/10/barack-obama-on-5-days-that-shaped-his-presidency.html">his interview with Chait</a>, Obama said that \u201cthe attitudes\u201d and \u201cmoods\u201d Palin \u201ccaptured during the [2008] election increasingly were representative of the Republican activist base, its core.\u201d</p>, <p>He stated:</p>, <p>I see a straight line from the announcement of Sarah Palin as the vice-presidential nominee to what we see today in Donald Trump, the emergence of the\xa0Freedom Caucus, the tea party, and the shift in the center of gravity for the Republican Party. Whether that changes, I think, will depend in part on the outcome of this election, but it\u2019s also going to depend on the degree of self-reflection inside the Republican\xa0Party. There have been at least a couple of other times that I\u2019ve said confidently that the fever is going to have to break, but it just seems to get worse.</p>, <p>Palin, who was an instrumental figure in the rise of the Tea Party movement and the Republican electoral victories that\xa0allowed the GOP to reclaim\xa0their\xa0House and Senate majorities, was an early supporter\xa0of Donald\xa0Trump. Her endorsement of Trump\xa0last January before the Iowa Caucuses was <a href="/web/20161004170900/http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/01/19/sarah-palin-to-endorse-donald-trump/">his first major endorsement</a>.</p>]
