[<p>\u201cI\u2019m a grandmother, and like every grandmother I worry about the safety and security of my grandchildren, but my worries are not the same as black grandmothers,\u201d Clinton said.</p>, <p>Clinton spoke at the Little Rock A.M.E. Church in Charlotte <a href="/web/20161004171409/http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/09/24/whoops-hillary-clinton-cancels-planned-trip-charlotte-mayor-begs-stay-home/">a week after she had to cancel </a>a scheduled appearance\xa0after the Democratic mayor of the city publicly asked her to wait.</p>, <p>Clinton\xa0admitted that her grandchildren didn\u2019t share the same fears as black Americans because of their white privilege.</p>, <p>\u201c[B]ecause my grandchildren are white, because they are the grandchildren of a former president and secretary of state, let\u2019s be honest here \u2013 they won\u2019t face the kind of fear that we heard from the young children testifying before the city council,\u201d she said.</p>, <p>She brought Charlotte girl Zianna Oliphant to the stage, after she made headlines by testifying at the city council about her fears of growing up as a black girl in America.</p>, <p>\u201cYou know, God loves us all, right?\u201d she asked her. \u201cWe are called to care for and cherish each other. It\u2019s not easy, it is not.\u201d</p>, <p>Clinton specifically referred to the shooting of Trayvon Martin, one of the first shootings that sparked protests from black Americans, insisting that he was just \u201cwalking home from the store with iced tea and Skittles.\u201d</p>, <p>She also quoted scripture, opening her speech with the Book of Psalms. \u201cThis is the day the Lord has made. Let us rejoice and be glad in it!\u201d she said.</p>, <p>She cited Proverbs, telling the audience, \u201cwhere there is no vision, the people perish\u201d and St. Paul\u2019s Letter to the Galatians, \u201cLet us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.\u201d</p>, <p>But Clinton also quoted her campaign slogan, calling for everyone in the Charlotte community to be \u201cstronger together.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cBeing stronger together with this common vision means rejecting those forces that try to pit us against each other,\u201d she said. We can acknowledge that implicit bias still exists, not just in police departments but throughout our country, without vilifying police officers.\u201d</p>]
