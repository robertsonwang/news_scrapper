[<p>\u201cIt\u2019s in his hands,\u201d Caddell told SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on <em>Breitbart News Daily.</em> \u201cWe still have not seen the rise of the refugee issue, which the Breitbart Gravis polls shows has emerged as a major issue.\u201d</p>, <p>Caddell also cited immigration as another issue on which Trump can win, if he emphasizes it: \u201cThat has yet to be raised as an issue.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cThe most important thing is, it\u2019s not done. This election is still in huge flux, partly because we have, as we have seen in the Breitbart polls\u2026 close to a quarter of voters who are unfavorable to both candidates,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd those voters swing back and forth. What\u2019s going to determine this election is, what happens with them, because they are the most volatile of the electorate.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cThe dynamics here are fluid,\u201d he added.</p>, <p><em>Breitbart News Daily</em> airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m.\xa0to 9:00 a.m.\xa0EST.</p>, <p><strong>LISTEN:</strong></p>, <p><iframe frameborder="no" height="450" scrolling="no" src="/web/20161004170249if_/https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/285836556&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true" width="100%"></iframe></p>, <p>\xa0</p>]
