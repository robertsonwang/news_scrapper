[<p>The club\xa0is playing in the Florida Cup in January 2017 for the third year in a row and management believes\xa0this is another step towards establishing a foothold in the world\u2019s most competitive marketplace.</p>, <p>The <a href="/web/20161004060620/http://www.bayer04.de/B04-ENG/en/_site_index.aspx">Bundesliga giants</a>\xa0recently signed Javier \u201cChicharito\u201d Hernandez (pictured), who is already known in the U.S. due to his Mexican heritage, and launched social media platforms in English and Spanish that have grown tremendously in the past year.</p>, <p>According to Bayer 04 Leverkusen director of marketing/communications, Jochen Rotthaus, there\u2019s no question North America in general and the U.S. market in particular is attractive to his club.</p>, <p>The success of <a href="/web/20161004060620/http://www.mlssoccer.com/">Major League Soccer</a> with\xa017 teams in the U.S. and three in Canada confirms that the base is real. He told Breitbart Sports: \u201cThe U.S. has a fast-growing soccer fan base \u2014 so it\u2019s a chance for us to pick up new fans \u2014 it\u2019s always an attractive market for sponsors and in this day of nearly 24/7 digital content and social media the U.S. has passionate soccer followers that are very connected and consume a lot of sports content.</p>, <p>\u201cWe see more and more opportunities for soccer in the U.S. \u2013 therefore we have been part of the Florida Cup for the past two years and will come back in January 2017.\u201d</p>, <p>Mr. Rotthaus uses\xa0Chicharito as an example of how a player can drive a fan base in new territory and draw fans through the power of brand recognition.</p>, <p>\u201cOf course, we know from our research and our conversations with experts in the U.S. that many consider Javier \u2018Chicharito\u2019 Hernandez to be among the top 2 or 3 most recognized soccer players in the U.S. as a result of the huge Mexican-American soccer fan base.</p>, <p>\u201cHe attended this past year\u2019s Florida Cup in January and our Spanish language news platforms like Twitter exploded with followers this past year. We are also very proud of the fact that Bayer 04 has always been a leader in the Bundesliga for developing talent.</p>, <p><span lang="EN-US">\u201cThe fact that we had five players recently selected to the German national team mean that any time Bayer 04 is playing in the U.S. or abroad, fans get a glimpse of some of Germany\u2019s best \u2013 whether that\u2019s young defender Jonathan Tah, striker JulianBrandt or perhaps goalie Bernd Leno.</span></p>, <p><span lang="EN-US">\u201cOthers that might get noticed in the U.S. are Copa America champion Charles Aranguiz of Chile and Hakan Calhanoglu from Turkey, considered one of the best free kick specialists in the world. Since the the U.S. trip in January will be a more or less regular training camp in order to get prepared for the second half of the Bundesliga season, all of those players will be taking part.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span lang="EN-US">The 2017 Florida Cup kicks off on January 7 with 14 teams from four federations with\xa0the final on January 21. After that the club will continue to push itself onto the global stage with plans to grow and reach further onto the international scene, according to Mr Rotthaus.</span></p>, <p><span lang="EN-US">\u201cRight now, our focus is really to reach out to people, directly and digitally, in a professional and sustainable way,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are \xa0seeking to grow our fan base significantly and to tie the people to our brand consistently. </span>We are considering another Asia trip again in the near future. We were there last in 2014.\u201d</p>]
