Oh\u2014and there\u2019s our weekly co-op park day, where we have organized sports, friends, and free play awaiting us.</p>, <p>If \u201cthe school experience includes building relationships with peers, teachers and mentors,\u201d then the home education experience includes building relationships with family, friends, and the surrounding community. My children are not limited to engaging only children their own age. How silly would it be if after being hired at a new job, the employer separated us into work areas by age? The public education system has fabricated this fantasy that a classroom is equivalent to the real world, which only serves a student as far as graduation. Homeschoolers learn and live life in the real world. We provide an individual instruction experience, instead of \u201crapid instructional experience.\u201d</p>, <p>Homeschooling parent Amber Shellenberger also reacted to King\u2019s comment that homeschoolers don\u2019t have a \u201crapid instructional experience.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Mr. King meant this statement to be a negative aspect of homeschooling, but I believe this can actually be an incredible benefit,\u201d she tells Breitbart News, explaining:</p>, <p>My kids and I are under very few time restraints when it comes to their schooling, so we can take our time to talk things over and actually learn rather than just memorize and move on to get a good grade on a test. I see this as building a very strong foundation for them when they are young.\xa0When they get older, they\u2019ll have a complete understanding of the educational basics so that they can build on that.\xa0Once my children have a good grasp on a subject, we move on.\xa0This can be five minutes or three days, but I don\u2019t see a point of rapid instruction if there isn\u2019t complete understanding by all students.</p>, <p>Shellenberger says she doubts King has done much research on homeschooling:</p>, <p>Just in our small community, we have a wonderful homeschool group that offers support, field trips, spelling bees, science fairs, dances, holiday festivities, and various tutorials.\xa0There are opportunities for music lessons, sports, theater acting, choir, art, career research and mentoring, 4H, and many, many more.\xa0Honestly, there is an equal number of opportunities for homeschoolers as there are for public schoolers, but the difference is that homeschoolers tend to have more time to get involved and take part in the extracurricular activities offered to them.</p>, <p>Like Riall, Shellenberger also asserts that it\u2019s time to put \u201cthe socialization myth\u201d to rest. She points out that homeschooled children can interact with others of a variety of ages \u2013 not simply those born in the same year. However, she also values that her children\u2019s social skills aren\u2019t \u201clearned by a group of kids who have no social skills of their own, but by my husband and I \u2013 two adults who can guide them and teach them social norms, good habits, manners, and conflict resolution.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cIn this kind of safe environment, I\u2019ve also noticed that my kids can each be themselves and aren\u2019t swayed by the influence of their peers,\u201d she adds.\xa0\u201cThey can build relationships with others by being themselves and sharing their interests rather than being afraid that someone will criticize them for being different.\xa0This is probably my favorite thing about homeschooling my kids!\u201d</p>, <p>Wisconsin homeschooling parent Sara Lehman says King\u2019s remarks suggest he presumes he knows what\u2019s best \u201cfor all kids.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly the problem with the state of government schools,\u201d she tells Breitbart News. \u201cWhat\u2019s also ironic is that his statement is in direct contradiction to why we choose to homeschool. We didn\u2019t want \u2018rapid (one size fits all) instruction\u2019 meant to push kids along regardless if they were actually gaining knowledge.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cThe quality of public education is a joke and I have to believe that these politicians know this,\u201d Lehman continues further:</p>, <p>Why else would their main argument against homeschooling be, continuously, about the \u201csocial\u201d aspect? My children are interacting with a broader range of people \u2013 a broader age range of children. They are actually getting a broader range of education than in public school as well. King\u2019s argument about that is debunked easily. Does not each school have a list of classes that students get to choose from? Based on funding, schools could have few options or many. Homeschoolers, however, are not restricted at all! Our options are limitless. Our children are getting a well- rounded education that focuses on learning \u2013 not grading, testing, and \u201csocializing.\u201d For many parents, the social aspect of government schooling is exactly what they don\u2019t want! In short, they have seen \u201cthe village,\u201d and don\u2019t want it raising their children.</p>, <p>However, Karen Braun \u2013 a <a href="/web/20161004171207/http://stopcommoncoreinmichigan.com/about-us/">Michigan</a> homeschooling mom of six \u2013 says that while homeschoolers may be tempted to reflexively react to King\u2019s comments with the response that they actually have the \u201cmost options,\u201d she sees a looming threat in the education secretary\u2019s remarks.</p>, <p>\u201cHe is actually saying something I have been talking about\xa0for quite a while,\u201d she tells Breitbart News, explaining:</p>, <p>Understanding his statement as it pertains to the transformation in education currently taking place is essential.\xa0This isn\u2019t as much about the parent being \u201cintentional\u201d\xa0as we might think of it, but more as the student being a part of the system with the intent of \u201ccareer readiness\u201d. Those that are part of the system have the range of options; those that aren\u2019t, do not.\xa0The reference for King\u2019s remarks is the competency-based system of education.</p>, <p>Braun warns homeschoolers \u201cwill have limited options in a competency-based education system \u2013 and that is by design.\u201d</p>, <p>She continues:</p>, <p>This is a system based on what is \u201cearned,\u201d not what is learned. It\u2019s Pok\xe9mon Go! for all learners. Students learn to earn \u201cdigital badges\u201d that allow them to advance higher in the system. Those that play their game advance, and those that don\u2019t, won\u2019t.</p>, <p>Homeschoolers don\u2019t play the feds\u2019 game, align to their standards, or compete for badges.\xa0Homeschoolers are driven by a desire to develop the mind and hearts of their children, not develop skilled workers.</p>, <p>Braun cites the example of a Michigan homeschooling student who was invited to attend the upcoming homecoming dance in the Wayne-Westland Community school district. A <a href="/web/20161004171207/http://www.michigancapitolconfidential.com/22830">report</a> last week at <em>Michigan Capitol Confidential</em>, however<em>, </em>says the school district responded with\xa0its policy that only homeschooled students coming from an \u201caccredited\u201d homeschool may attend dances within the district.</p>, <p>\u201cThat would effectively ban homeschoolers from attending dances held by the district since homeschoolers have no reason to be accredited and the state doesn\u2019t require it,\u201d says the report.</p>, <p>\u201cThis is a concrete example of \u2018limited\u2019 options based on accreditation,\u201d says Braun \u2013 who was quoted in the news report.\xa0\u201cIf the state can restrict homeschoolers from a dance based on accreditation, they can restrict or limit them elsewhere.\u201d</p>, <p>Like Braun, Wisconsin homeschooling parent <a href="/web/20161004171207/http://hsroadmap.org/common-core-project/">Tina Hollenbeck</a> also responds to the fact that the U.S. education chief is making a judgment about homeschooling \u2013 a clear violation, she says, of the Constitution.</p>, <p>\u201cWhat is really irksome is that he feels he has a right to an opinion <em>at all</em>,\u201d she tells Breitbart News. \u201cThe bottom-line fact is that his job, and the very existence of the Department of Education, violates the 10th Amendment, which means that anything he says about <em>any</em> form of schooling is actually illegitimate.\u201d</p>, <p>Hollenbeck asserts King was \u201c<em>grossly </em>out of line to express <em>any</em> public opinion about homeschooling \u2013 which falls <em>far</em> out of the realm of anything for which he is ostensibly responsible.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cThe focus shouldn\u2019t be on arguing against his ignorance,\u201d she asserts. \u201cInstead, it should be on pointing out that he has irresponsibly spoken in an official capacity about something over which he has absolutely no authority.\u201d</p>]
