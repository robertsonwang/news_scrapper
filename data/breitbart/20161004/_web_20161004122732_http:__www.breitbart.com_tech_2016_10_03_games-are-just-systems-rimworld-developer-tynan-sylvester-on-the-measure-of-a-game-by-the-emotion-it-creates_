[<p>Speaking to Sylvester was a particularly unique experience. It recalled watching exchanges with the likes of Will Wright or Gabe Newell. There\u2019s a lot going on under the hood, nothing haphazard or erratic. He has Molyneux-esque ambition, but without the infamous <em>Fable</em> creator\u2019s penchant for empty claims and blustery\xa0promises. He\u2019s measured, stubborn, and critical of everything \u2014 but none more so than himself.</p>, <p>It was a refreshing conversation. Marketing fluff never entered the conversation, and amidst the thoughtful observations and bold design assertions was a dry wit and self-awareness that very few who attain such success manage to keep.</p>, <p>This is the first of three parts\xa0and focuses on Tynan\u2019s personal history, as well as the design philosophies he describes in his book, <a href="/web/20161004181357/https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Games-Guide-Engineering-Experiences-ebook/dp/B00AWKX1FO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1474648137&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=designing+games+engineering+experiences"><em>Designing Games: A Guide To Engineering Experiences</em></a>.</p>, <p>\xa0</p>, <p><strong>Nate:</strong>\xa0Let\u2019s start with your \u201corigin story.\u201d I understand\xa0that you worked for Irrational on <em>Bioshock Infinite</em>?</p>, <p><strong>Tynan:</strong> Actually, the\xa0more relevant part of my background comes long before Irrational. In fact, I actually started by doing modding for classic<em> Unreal Tournament</em> \u2014 the 1999 version \u2014 back in the day. And I was in high school when I was doing this. I used to make maps, and I made a full conversion mod I called \u201cElemental Conflict,\u201d and that is really where I started doing game development. Back then I was sort of working by myself, independently or with teams of people remotely, and that\u2019s kind of what I ended up doing in the end.</p>, <p>So, that was the origin of it. Then, after a while, I went to university. I kept doing indie game projects on the side \u2014 really terrible ones, like I was just <em>totally awful</em>, but you know, just racking up the experience and trying to learn what was going on. After university, I went and I worked at\xa0Irrational for 4 years, which was mostly spent on <em>Bioshock Infinite</em>, and I left a year before that game released. So I wasn\u2019t there right at the end, but I worked on systems design and weapon design and enemy design and a bunch of sort of random combat-oriented tasks.</p>, <p>Ultimately, I found that working as one person in a studio with 100+ people wasn\u2019t that gratifying to me, personally. So, I really liked, you know, having the freedom to approach problems the way I wanted. I really liked the freedom to try different things, and\xa0essentially solve things the way I thought they should be solved. So, I saved up some money and I quit.</p>, <p>And I basically was just burning through my savings to try to build up prototypes for an indie game. I didn\u2019t know what it would be. I wrote a game design book at this time \u2014 which is partially to do something that I thought would have some significance for other people, and partially just as a learning project for myself \u2014 and I got it published with O\u2019Reilly Media. It\u2019s called <em>Designing Games</em>.</p>, <p>And that, I think, was probably the event that I guess matured me as a game designer, and crystallized everything I\u2019d been trying to learn over the last ten years before that. Because I got to take it all, and actually write down my thoughts, instead of having them just this sort of foggy, blurry, swirly format in my head. And I think that really helped develop the tools that I used later on to make <em>RimWorld</em> and the methodologies.</p>, <p>So, I quit. I finished the book. And then I started working on independent gaming designs and I made a sequence of prototypes. Each one took about a month. There was this zombie survivor game, where you had this group of survivors and you\u2019d go and try to survive in a zombie world. There was this mercenary management game, where it was this sort of business simulation of running a mercenary company. There was this game where you ran this, like, Hogwart\u2019s wizard school simulation, and a starship building game.</p>, <p>Ultimately, I tried them all, and they didn\u2019t work as well as I wanted them to. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a tough decision to just\xa0give up on a game you\u2019re working on, because you\u2019re like, \u201cIf I worked on it more, would it <em>become</em> fun, or is it just a dead concept in the first place?\u201d</p>, <p><strong>Nate:</strong> And then there\u2019s that\xa0whole \u201csunk cost\u201d feeling too, I\u2019m sure.</p>, <p><strong>Tynan:</strong> Yeah. It\u2019s brutal. And I just did this like five times in a row, month after month, throwing it out each time. So it\u2019s a tricky decision. And based on what I wrote in the book, it sort of crystallized my belief that a game design really sort of \u201chits\u201d or doesn\u2019t pretty early on. Like, it either works or it doesn\u2019t, in a very simple state.</p>, <p>So, I kept changing it, and it turned out well because <em>RimWorld</em> \u2014 which was called \u201cEclipse Colony\u201d at the time, as its temporary development name \u2014 did work. I had a couple friends over at around\xa010pm to play it \u2014 this was the first time anyone had played the game besides me \u2014 and it was still super simple. It was\xa0just\xa0yellow dots for the colonists, and very, very simplistic. And they wouldn\u2019t leave. They wouldn\u2019t stop playing for like four hours, and we all were falling asleep at like 2am before they would actually stop.</p>, <p>So, that\u2019s when I kind of knew, \u201cYeah, this is going to work.\u201d I worked on it for like six more months and then put the Kickstarter out in late 2015, and I\u2019ve been working on <em>RimWorld</em> ever since.</p>, <p><strong>Nate:</strong>\xa0You had mentioned the book, <em><a href="/web/20161004181357/https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Games-Guide-Engineering-Experiences-ebook/dp/B00AWKX1FO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1474648137&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=designing+games+engineering+experiences">Designing Games: A Guide to Engineering Experiences</a></em>. Out of curiosity, I dipped into it a bit myself.\xa0It\u2019s probably the most interesting writing about game design theory that I\u2019ve ever read.</p>, <p><strong>Tynan:</strong> Glad to hear it!</p>, <p><strong>Nate:</strong> I think it\u2019s arguably more useful than something that gives specific technical tips, or instruction on how to accomplish a certain task, like the \u201cRight Way To Do Gun Progression.\u201d\xa0It\u2019s more like a thesis on the psychology of games and design. For the benefit of those who haven\u2019t yet taken a look, would you care to talk a bit about it?</p>, <p><strong>Tynan:</strong>\xa0The basic thesis of the book is that the purpose of a game is to create an <em>experienc</em>e for the players. And the key aspect of any experience that makes it compelling is the emotions that you feel while you\u2019re having it. So, that\u2019s the core thread of the book \u2014 essentially, a guide to engineering experiences, which means a guide to creating systems, which is\xa0really\xa0what games are. Games are just\xa0systems, like a computer system, or a mechanical system, like an old arcade pinball machine, or just sort of an abstract system, like a game you can play with words, or a game you play with pieces on a board.</p>, <p>They\u2019re all just systems, but their purpose is the same, which is to create experiences with the people who are interacting with them, and to make those experiences compelling. Which means making those experiences emotional in some sense. So, that\u2019s the core idea of it, and the rest of it is essentially analyzing how to make this happen effectively using game design tools of almost any medium.</p>, <p>Obviously I\u2019m a video game designer, but the principles are the same in board games or electro-mechanical \u201carcade\u201d games, or word games, or social games, or even other sort of experience-creation media, like if you\u2019re putting on a show for people. It\u2019s a very broad thing. It focuses on psychology because that\u2019s what games are about; you\u2019re sort of tweaking with the player\u2019s brain. You\u2019re creating this machine that the player\u2019s going to plug their brain into through their eyes and their hands, and the machine \u2014 the game \u2014 is going to try to make them feel something.</p>, <p>So, you can make a game that targets different types of emotions. For example, if you make a horror game, you\u2019re looking for this mixture of jump scares and dread and interest and disgust. You\u2019re just trying to tweak people, right? Or if you\u2019re making like classic <em>Minecraft</em>, you\u2019re looking for this feeling of contented satisfaction, maybe intermixed with a little bit of trepidation about the night or threats that are coming after you, and a sense of sort of social humor that you would have if you were playing with your friends and make a big dick or something like that, you know?</p>, <p><strong>Nate:</strong> [laughs]\xa0I wouldn\u2019t know anything about making a big dick in <em>Minecraft</em>. (This is\xa0a bald-faced lie.)</p>, <p><strong>Tynan:</strong> So it\u2019s essentially taken that lens. And you can look at it as the core view I have of games, because it\u2019s the only one that I think applies universally. It\u2019s not like \u201chow to solve this narrow problem better,\u201d or like you mentioned making a better gun progression or something like that.</p>, <p>You have to ask <em>why</em> you make a better gun progression, like what are you actually trying to accomplish here? Well, you\u2019re trying to create a nice set of emotions. So, if the gun progression is broken, it\u2019ll have big long periods where nothing happens, and then you\u2019re developing emotions of boredom. Or, it\u2019ll progress too quickly and leave players confused, which creates unpleasant senses of cognizant effort and a sense of being overwhelmed, which people don\u2019t tend to like.</p>, <p>So, how do you make the \u201cright\u201d gun progression? Well, it\u2019s the one that gives you the emotions you want the player to have. And I think that that has been really key for <em>RimWorld</em> as well, because once you take this view, it\u2019s really about choosing the emotions you want, and then trying to create them. You can sort of step outside some of the assumptions that I think ruin a lot of games. Like, there\u2019s a very common assumption that games have to revolve around challenge and victory, which, you know, sports do tend to do, and so do these classic arcade games.</p>, <p>But a lot of people, just at the core of what they say about games, is\xa0the\xa0core assumption \u2014 unquestioned and unconsidered \u2014 that it has to revolve around \u201ctriumph.\u201d Which <em>is</em> an emotion; triumph is a great emotion. But there\u2019s other experiences you can target as well. Which, you can\u2019t do with triumph, because not every emotion can go with every other emotion; they don\u2019t always mix, like in a dish, right? So sometimes you have to give up triumph.</p>, <p><strong>Nate:</strong> One emotion isn\u2019t compatible with <em>every</em> human experience.</p>, <p><strong>Tynan:</strong> Yeah, like you can\u2019t mix a horror game and this sort of happy children\u2019s building game and like this hardcore triumph game. They\u2019re different emotions; you\u2019re targeting different things.</p>, <p><strong>Nate:</strong> Do you feel like that\u2019s lacking in the AAA space?</p>, <p><strong>Tynan:</strong> Definitely. I mean, they\u2019re quite risk-averse. Some of them get into it. But it\u2019s a very slow progression. I think indie is really where all of the interesting experiments are going to happen, which is obvious because indie is where you\u2019re not spending $50 million dollars.</p>, <p><strong>Nate:</strong> Right. Same with music and film; the indie scene tends to push forward change.</p>, <p><strong>Tynan:</strong> Yeah, pretty much. And that\u2019s fine. That\u2019s why you see games like <em>Abzu</em> recently, where there\u2019s no triumph, there\u2019s no challenge, you just sort of go around and feel the atmosphere and the ambiance, swimming, and this beautiful underwater space, and various other experimental indie games. And then there\u2019s a million details of how to actually \u201coperationalize\u201d that, and actually apply it, and kind of develop the sense for \u2026 you know, when I was pushing too hard, or how to feel those emotions that most people don\u2019t feel.</p>, <p>I think one of the most interesting subsections\xa0of the book is that\xa0it talks about the emotions that people don\u2019t realize they have. I think most people, when they think \u201cemotion,\u201d they think of tearful crying sessions, or a huge sense of overwhelming triumph. But the reality is, emotions are <em>very</em> fine-grained and they\u2019re hitting you all the time at every moment.</p>, <p>Like from one half-second to the next, your emotions will change.\xa0A cat jumps out of a box. First it\u2019s two seconds of curiosity, followed by one second of confused anticipation when the box makes a noise, followed by a half second of fear when the cat jumps out, followed by a few seconds of exhilaration mixed with fright, followed by this sort of cuddly happiness.</p>, <p>And that\u2019s like \u2014 you\u2019re going through like seven or eight emotions within ten seconds, right? Which I think is fascinating. When you\u2019re doing a game design, you want to analyze it on <em>that</em> level, a very fine-grained level. And you can! It\u2019s interesting, and you can create a worthwhile experience using that. So it\u2019s not just academic either, which I find really compelling.</p>, <p><strong>Nate:</strong>\xa0Speaking of \xa0things \u201cacademic,\u201d I noticed <a href="/web/20161004181357/https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/4tm6i1/i_am_tynan_sylvester_developer_of_rimworld_ama/">in one of the Reddit AMAs</a> you said you learned basically nothing in school about creating games, and that a lot of it came just by doing it, by personal experience. Do you think that higher education is a valuable thing to pursue when getting into games, or do you think that\u2019s just adding empty debt to something you\u2019re just going to have to do on your own anyway?</p>, <p><strong>Tynan:</strong> I think it depends what you want to do. You know, for study in technology or art, there\u2019s some great programs. And if you want to be a really hardcore programmer or a really great artist, I think it\u2019s possible to do those on your own, but I think there are also good programs. I\u2019m not an expert in that field, but I think in terms of game design, like actual game design \u2014 not like \u201cwe\u2019re going to call it game design but it\u2019s actually programming\u201d \u2014 but in <em>actual</em> game design, I really don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything out there.</p>, <p>It\u2019s just not a mature field. And it\u2019s a field that\u2019s so immature that there\u2019s almost zero supply of game designers, there\u2019s almost no public knowledge of what it\u2019s really about, or any general comprehension that this is something that exists, and it is distinct from programming. Half of these game design programs are really just coding programs, and the general level of knowledge is so low and so concentrated in those few people that are actually doing it, who are still doing it, that I really don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any worthwhile game design programs that I\u2019ve seen or heard of.</p>, <p>I think that anyone who wants to get into it would be far better served doing it on their own. That said, I could be wrong. This is obviously advice tailored from me, and I\u2019m a very independence-minded person. Someone who wants to work in a big company or is more social like that might get more out of it, but from what I\u2019ve seen there\u2019s really nothing there. The people who learn to do it have learned to do it by doing it, and they\u2019re still doing it because this industry is really only a few decades old and we really haven\u2019t had time for people to get old and write their retirement books yet, you know? It\u2019s going to take a century before it <em>really</em> matures, you know?</p>, <p><strong>Nate:</strong> That\u2019s a very\xa0good point.</p>, <p><strong>Tynan:</strong> So, like, even when computers were invented, they still came from mathematical principles that had existed before. But in terms of game design, it\u2019s sort of trying to bootstrap off of movies or programming. It\u2019s like you\u2019re bootstrapping off of programming, which is a completely different field, so it\u2019s just this really fucked up \u2014 it\u2019s in this really fucked up state. So I think it\u2019s going to take fifty or a hundred years before there\u2019s really a mature education system. Because we need two generations of people to retire and write their books and so on and so forth. That\u2019s my opinion.</p>, <p><strong>Nate:</strong>\xa0You\u2019ve said that you learned a lot in the course of writing the book. What are some of the things that it taught <em>you</em>?</p>, <p><strong>Tynan:</strong>\xa0That\u2019s something that\u2019s really hard to describe, right? Because it\u2019s like knowledge that you had beforehand \u2014 like, how do you organize your own knowledge? Before I wrote the book, I would describe the state of my mind as having a huge amount of reference experiences \u2014 by which I mean, memories of things that\u2019d happened, or games I\u2019d played, or experiences I\u2019d had working at Irrational, or things I\u2019d tried in making games that worked or didn\u2019t work.</p>, <p>I had tons of those \u201creference experiences,\u201d because I\u2019d been doing this for years and years. I had all these games I\u2019d played, I had a ton of thoughts and ideas about how they should work, I had a huge amount of advice that I\u2019d heard, or just design articles I\u2019d read. But it was all just sloshing around in my brain without a system of organization.</p>, <p>I think writing the book, for me, was beneficial because it allowed me to take all that knowledge and crystallize it into a structure I could really work with, and really use to sort of prioritize things, or know when to reference one experience over another, or when one concept should connect to another or override another, and so on and so forth.</p>, <p>It\u2019s exceptionally hard to describe, this sort of learning, because it\u2019s not like a fact-oriented learning, or episodic learning, it really is an incredibly intuitive thing. It\u2019s the difference between, you know, ten years ago or even a few years ago if I looked at a game design problem and you just asked me what we should do, I would just give a totally different answer from now. But in either case, can I really explain <em>why</em> the answer is different? So, it\u2019s a very tacit knowledge thing. I\u2019m sorry if this answer is unsatisfying.</p>, <p><strong>Nate:</strong> Not at all. There\u2019s a lot to digest! A lot of people are struggling to learn the same things you have.</p>, <p><strong>Tynan:</strong> I think that for anyone working on their game design skill, writing about it, and really working at writing about it and releasing those articles, is essential. So, I\u2019ve written on Gamasutra as well, I\u2019ve written design articles which were also helpful and anyone can read for free. I\u2019d totally recommend that.</p>, <p>There\u2019s <a href="/web/20161004181357/http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/TynanSylvester/20130602/193462/The_Simulation_Dream.php">a design article on Gamasutra called \u201cThe Simulation Dream,\u201d</a> which is the last one I wrote a few years ago, a little bit before I made <em>RimWorld</em> actually. And you can really see the connection to RimWorld from that article. It\u2019s sort of a taste of the kind of thing my book tends to say.</p>, <p>\xa0</p>, <p>In part 2 of the interview, we discuss the indie gaming scene, VR,\xa0and the future of the gaming industry at large.</p>, <p><em>Follow\xa0Nate\xa0Church\xa0</em><a href="/web/20161004181357/https://twitter.com/Get2Church" target="_blank"><em>@Get2Church</em></a><em>\xa0on Twitter for the latest news in gaming and technology, and snarky opinions on both.</em></p>]
