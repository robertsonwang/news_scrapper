He remains Buddhism\u2019s highest authority, however, a prestigious title the Chinese government has endeavored to tarnish, from dismissing the Dalai Lama\u2019s assurances he will pick a successor in his lifetime to <a href="/web/20161004170607/http://time.com/3743742/dalai-lama-china-reincarnation-tibet-buddhism/">likening him to the violent radicals</a> of the Islamic State.</p>, <p>In December, the Chinese government <a href="/web/20161004170607/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2015/12/10/china-dalai-lama-has-sympathy-for-islamic-state/">openly referred to the Dalai Lama</a> as a \u201cviolent extremist\u201d and \u201cIslamic State sympathizer,\u201d citing comments the Dalai Lama made urging dialogue with the terrorist organization. \u201cBy saying, \u2018listen, understand and respect\u2019 them, it exposes, in his very bones, his sympathy or endorsement for ISIS,\u201d Chinese Ethnic and Religious Affairs Committee chairman Zhu Weiqun said of the Dalai Lama, as quoted by Chinese state propaganda.</p>, <p>The Chinese outlet\xa0<em>People\u2019s Daily</em> <a href="/web/20161004170607/http://en.people.cn/n3/2016/0915/c90000-9115323.html">reiterated the accusation</a> earlier this month. \u201cWhile traveling in the European country, [the Dalai Lama]\xa0urged talks with the Islamic State extremists, saying talks are \u2018the only way\u2019 to end bloodshed in Syria and Iraq without explaining how that is possible,\u201d an editorial titled \u201cShocking IS comments good chance for some Westerners to see Dalai Lama\u2019s real face\u201d read.</p>, <p>To counter the Dalai Lama\u2019s influence, the communist Chinese state is working to elevate the profile of the second most powerful authority in the religion, the Panchen Lama.\xa0Both titles are the product of reincarnation \u2014 the current Dalai Lama is considered the 14th incarnation of a 14th century monk \u2014 with the living Buddhas helping find each other. The Dalai Lama found a six-year-old boy,\xa0Gendun Choekyi Nyima, whom he named the Panchen Lama in 1995.
