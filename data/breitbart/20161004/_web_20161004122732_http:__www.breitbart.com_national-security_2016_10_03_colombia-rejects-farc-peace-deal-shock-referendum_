[<p>In one of the closest major referendums of modern times, 50.24% of voters rejected the deal to bring the war to an end, whilst 49.76% backed it.</p>, <p>The main reason reporters have suggested for the result was a feeling that the concessions given to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), who are responsible for the deaths of over 260,000 people over a war spanning 52 years, were too lenient.</p>, <p>Some of the concessions included the communist group becoming a political party and holding\xa0three\xa0seats in the Colombian national congress. There were also terms of amnesty for most FARC members, whilst some of\xa0the most prolific criminals would face shortened jail sentences.</p>, <p>In return, FARC had agreed to lay down their arms as well as ending their operations in the illegal drug trade, which was one of their primary sources of income.</p>, <p>The result is a huge setback for Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos, who had previously addressed the United Nations to celebrate the 297-page deal, adding that he was \u201cvery, very confident\u201d that Colombians would accept\xa0it.</p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" src="/web/20161004160854if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/gDMPMLGn5zM" width="560"></iframe></p>, <p>On hearing the\xa0result of the referendum, Santos said that he accepted the democratic decision and would continue to be the \u201cguarantor of Colombia\u2019s stability and maintain public order.\u201d</p>, <p>He added\xa0that he would continue to \u201cseek and negotiate for peace.\u201d</p>, <p><em>You can follow Ben Kew <a href="/web/20161004160854/https://www.facebook.com/benjkew/?skip_nax_wizard=true" target="_blank">on Facebook</a>, on Twitter at <a href="/web/20161004160854/https://twitter.com/ben_kew" target="_blank">@ben_kew</a>,\xa0or\xa0email him at ben@yiannopoulos.net</em></p>]
