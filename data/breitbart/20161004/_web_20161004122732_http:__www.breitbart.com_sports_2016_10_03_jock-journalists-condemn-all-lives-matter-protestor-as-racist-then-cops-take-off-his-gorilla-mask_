[<p>The masked man ran about half the length of Soldier Field toward the end zone and ran back in the opposite direction, employing several evasive jukes to avoid his pursuers, before taking a don\u2019t-hit-me-I\u2019m-a-quarterback slide near the 40. Four security guards, ignoring NFL rules, quickly pounced on the costumed man despite his feet-first, I-give-up slide.</p>, <p>The man wore a t-shirt that read \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d on the front. On the back, it read: \u201cPut Down the Guns.\u201d</p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">A guy dressed as a gorilla wearing an \u201call lives matter\u201d shirt just ran onto the field at the Bears game <a href="/web/20161004060609/https://t.co/QJLfuS1b1U">pic.twitter.com/QJLfuS1b1U</a></p>, <p>\u2014 Nik Gaur (@Gaur_Nik) <a href="/web/20161004060609/https://twitter.com/Gaur_Nik/status/782664322241613824">October 2, 2016</a></p>, <p><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="/web/20161004060609js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></p>, <p>Chicago has witnessed 545 murders in 2016. Despite placing third in population, the Windy City counts more killings than New York City and Los Angeles combined this year. Sports journalists rush to defend political points made on the field in the wake of Colin Kaepernick kneeling for the national anthem. Protesting black men killing other black men in a majority-minority city, however, just doesn\u2019t strike tastemakers as fashionable the way \u201cHands Up, Don\u2019t Shoot\u201d does.</p>, <p>Sports writers quickly denounced the \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d stunt as racism.</p>, <p>Jay Busbee at Yahoo Sports, for instance, <a href="/web/20161004060609/http://sports.yahoo.com/news/fan-in-gorilla-suit-rip-harambeall-lives-matter-shirt-runs-on-field-in-chicago-203132879.html">wrote</a> that \u201cwearing an \u2018All Lives Matter\u2019 shirt over a gorilla costume\u2014well, that\u2019s either breathtaking ignorance or just straight-out, no-question racism.\u201d Corey Collins of Sporting News <a href="/web/20161004060609/http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/man-charged-with-running-onto-field-in-gorilla-suit-at-bears-game/">described</a> the uninvited runner\u2019s display as \u201cjuvenile, pretty-racist, attention-seeking behavior.\u201d</p>, <p>Only when the cops unmasked the man in the gorilla suit they discovered a 31-year-old African American wearing dreadlocks. \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d hardly strikes as rhetoric akin to \u201cSegregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.\u201d But among sports scribes, a dim bunch more eager to prove their ideological <em>bona fides</em> than their writing chops, charging \u201cracism\u201d with volume and repetition comes as part of the job description.</p>, <p>The Chicago police <a href="/web/20161004060609/http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/man-charged-with-running-onto-field-in-gorilla-suit-at-bears-game/">charged</a> Tennessean Angelo Graham with criminal trespass in a place of amusement.
