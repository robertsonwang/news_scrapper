[<p>Clinton arrived on stage at 1:44 PM Eastern for a rally that was supposed to begin at noon Eastern, an hour and forty-four minutes earlier.</p>, <p>\u201cWhen I saw Hillary in that debate\u2026every American who watched it, unless they were just so knotted up with anger and resentment\u201d saw a clear contrast in the candidates\u2019 experience, Clinton said.</p>, <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re mad then it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Clinton said.</p>, <p>Clinton then mockingly assumed the voice of angry Americans.</p>, <p>\u201cI\u2019m mad about immigration, I\u2019m mad about trade, I\u2019m mad because my wages aren\u2019t going up,\u201d Clinton said, painting the divide in the country as a battle between \u201cthe voters of Hope vs. the voters of fear.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cMost of the anti-immigration feeling in America is in places that don\u2019t have a lot of immigrants. We\u2019ve got to stop fighting over this,\u201d Clinton said.</p>, <p>He noted that the election should not be about \u201cinsults, tax evasion, abuse of the family foundation or whatever\u201d because that\u2019s not what matters to regular people.</p>, <p>\u201cThe Democrats have a pretty good argument. I made it four years ago for President Obama,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cIs this a change election? Yes it is, and it should be. But the question should be: what are we going to do? What kind of change do you need?\u2026Do we want anger or answers? Do we want resentment or empowerment? And do we want to reach the world with walls or bridges?\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s the whole thing,\u201d Clinton said to mild applause.</p>, <p>Clinton said that we can\u2019t \u201cput everyone in manufacturing\u201d because \u201cevery year, fewer people can produce more stuff.\u201d</p>, <p>Clinton came out in favor of tariffs on companies that ship jobs overseas, specifically citing the case of Carrier air conditioners in Indiana in a direct ripoff of one of Donald Trump\u2019s main talking points. \u201cNo we\u2019re going to take the gains away from you if you do that,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is Hillary\u2019s position.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cOh, the Democrats they\u2019re coming for your guns, they\u2019re coming for your guns. They said that about me. And we banned assault weapons\u201d but everyone in Michigan was still able to go hunting and protect their families, Clinton said. \u201cIt is a bunch of bull!\u201d</p>, <p>Clinton made a bizarre reference to the Civil War, paraphrasing a friend who is a Lincoln expert who explained one of the reasons Lincoln went to war: \u201cIn the North there was no power elite, there was no slave labor, it was the greatest opportunity for people who started out poor to get into the middle class. We\u2019ve got to do that again.\u201d</p>]
