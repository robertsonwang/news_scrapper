On April 28,\xa0<a href="/web/20161004060955/http://www.thepostgame.com/eye-performance/201604/carson-wentz-nfl-draft-hunting-north-dakota">The Post Game</a>\xa0asked Wentz what he likes to do off the field. He said:</p>, <p>Hunting is big. I fish a little bit, but I\u2019m more into the hunting world. I fell in love with it when I was in college. It\u2019s a release from football to get away. In college, it\u2019s football all the time. Going forward, it\u2019s going to be football, football, football. Hunting is a good release, good way to get away from the game and just decompress, even it\u2019s just for a couple hours. I\u2019ve always enjoyed it. I\u2019ve got a 3-year-old golden retriever that I\u2019ve raised. She hunts with me too. She loves it. Always makes it more enjoyable.</p>, <p>When they asked him what roll the dog plays in his hunting excursions, Wentz said: \u201cWhen we\u2019re bird hunting, so duck and goose hunting and also pheasants, she\u2019ll fetch the birds and swim after the birds in the hunting water. She loves it. When I wake up at 3:30, 4 in the morning, she knows what\u2019s going on. She sees me grab the gun, she\u2019s ready to go, she\u2019s fired up. She might even love it more than I do.\u201d</p>, <p>The <a href="/web/20161004060955/http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/17669846/carson-wentz-goes-hunting-continued-success">Associated Press</a> reports that Wentz was named the NFL\u2019s Rookie of the Month for September.</p>, <p><em>AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
