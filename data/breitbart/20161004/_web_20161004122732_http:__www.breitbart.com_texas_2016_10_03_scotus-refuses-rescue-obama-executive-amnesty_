[<p>\u201cThe State of Texas\u2019 position has been validated by the U.S. Supreme Court today as they denied the Obama administration\u2019s petition to rehear the immigration case,\u201d Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in response. \u201cRewriting national immigration law requires the full and careful consideration of Congress. This is the latest setback to the president\u2019s attempt to expand executive power and another victory for those who believe in the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers and the rule of law.\u201d</p>, <p>As reported by Breitbart Texas on June 23, the nation\u2019s highest court left in place a block of President Obama\u2019s unlawful executive amnesty dictate. The eight-member court has a vacancy left by the death of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. On that date, the Court stalled the federal government\u2019s executive amnesty order with a 4-4 vote. The tied decision in <em><a href="/web/20161004154311/https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docketfiles/15-674.htm">United States v. Texas, et al.</a></em> left in place the lower court decision.</p>, <p>These decisions highlight the importance of the upcoming presidential election in the country.\xa0While the president may have lost this round in his over-reaching use of executive power, the next president will select a replacement for conservative U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Scalia died in mid-February while staying at a ranch in west Texas, as\xa0<a href="/web/20161004154311/http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/02/13/supreme-court-justice-antonin-scalia-dies-at-west-texas-ranch/">reported</a>\xa0by Breitbart Texas at the time. Republicans have refused to vote on Obama\u2019s nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, as\xa0<a href="/web/20161004154311/http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/03/16/mcconnell-the-senate-will-continue-to-follow-the-biden-rule-ignore-garland/">reported</a>\xa0by Breitbart News.</p>, <p>As\xa0<a href="/web/20161004154311/http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2015/11/09/appeals-court-stops-obamas-executive-amnesty/">reported</a>\xa0by Breitbart Texas, the Fifth Circuit issued a ruling in November 2015\xa0effectively putting the brakes on\xa0President Obama\u2019s November 2014 executive amnesty order.\xa0The Fifth Circuit ruled that the lower federal district court did not err in granting a\xa0halt to Obama\u2019s executive amnesty program. U.S. District Court Judge Andrew Hanen previously issued the order\xa0stopping the president\u2019s actions, as\xa0<a href="/web/20161004154311/http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/02/16/breaking-texas-federal-court-issues-injunction-to-stop-obamas-executive-amnesty/">reported</a>\xa0by Breitbart Texas.</p>, <p>President Obama used executive action to dictate that the DAPA program (Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents) be implemented. Then-Attorney General Greg Abbott (now Texas Governor) filed suit challenging the executive order and led a coalition of 26 states to fight the effort. The case involved the issues of the proper scope of presidential power to bypass Congress, the Immigration and Nationality Act passed by Congress, and violations of the Administrative Procedure Act and other federal laws.</p>, <p>As\xa0<a href="/web/20161004154311/http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/06/23/amnesty-blocked-tied-supreme-court-next-president-will-decide-whether-restart/">noted</a>\xa0by Breitbart News, the Court declined to rule on the notice-and-comment provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The APA requires a time period for notice to and comment from the public before issuing rules that create public policy mirroring law. A ruling that the federal government violated the provisions would have provided for transparency and government accountability, he wrote.</p>, <p><a href="/web/20161004154311/http://www.breitbart.com/author/lana-shadwick/"><em>Lana Shadwick</em></a><em>\xa0is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.
