[<p>Donald Trump reportedly avoided paying federal income taxes by reporting massive losses on his 1995 tax return, which the\xa0<a href="/web/20161004153356/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html"><em>New York Times</em></a> somehow obtained before Trump himself released it.</p>, <p><a href="/web/20161004153356/http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trumps-tax-numbers-tighten-focus-on-treatment-of-losses-1475415294">The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> </a>describes the loophole that Trump used:</p>, <p>The tax treatment of losses, bound to become a subject of national debate, is a typically noncontroversial feature of the income-tax system. The government doesn\u2019t pay net refunds when business owners lose money, but it lets taxpayers use those losses to smooth their tax payments as they make money. That reflects the fact that \u201cthe natural business cycle of a taxpayer may exceed 12 months,\u201d according to a congressional report.</p>, <p>Typically, for federal returns, such net operating losses can be carried backward for two years to offset past income and then kept on a taxpayer\u2019s books for 20 years, though Mr. Trump\u2019s losses could only qualify for a 15-year carryforward under the law at the time.</p>, <p>The Clinton campaign has hammered Trump on his unreleased tax returns. When pundits on cable news now refer to the \u201cTaxes\u201d issue, they\u2019re usually talking about Trump\u2019s personal \u201ctaxes\u201d issue, not the taxes paid by American voters.</p>, <p><a href="/web/20161004153356/http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-02/clinton-campaign-admits-hillary-used-same-tax-avoidance-scheme-trump">But the Zerohedge blog</a> first noticed something that could undercut Clinton\u2019s ability to hit Trump on his \u201cnet operating losses.\u201d</p>, <p><a href="/web/20161004153356/https://m.hrc.onl/secretary/10-documents/01-health-financial-records/Clinton_2015_Form_1040_with_Signature_Page.pdf">Clinton\u2019s 2015 tax returns</a> reveal that Hillary Clinton also reported capital gains losses in order to lessen her tax burden through a \u201ccarryover.\u201d</p>, <p>Page 17 of the tax returns show \u201cCapital Gains and Losses\u201d for \u201cWILLIAM J CLINTON &amp; HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON.\u201d</p>, <p>The Clintons reported a \u201cLong-term capital loss carryover\u201d of $699,540.</p>, <p>Thus, the Clintons reported a \u201cNet long-term capital gain or (loss)\u201d of \u201c-699,540.\u201d</p>, <p>Clinton campaign spokesman Nick Merrill did not immediately return Breitbart News\u2019s request for comment.</p>]
