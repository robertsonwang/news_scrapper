If we\u2019ve done our jobs properly, they also have more laughs and suspense \u2013 and\xa0<i>much</i>\xa0better artwork,\u201d Smith said in a recent interview. \u201c<i>Clinton Cash: A Graphic Novel</i>\xa0is the most subversive foray into pop culture the right has ever attempted and, more importantly, it has been successful.\xa0So successful and effective in fact that it was recently banned from the shelves of a Florida Public Library.\u201d</p>, <p>Indeed, as <a href="/web/20161004124800/http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/09/20/florida-library-bans-clinton-cash-graphic-novel-from-shelves/" target="_blank">Breitbart News reported</a>, the\xa0Alachua County Library District denied\xa0county\xa0resident Ann Loot\u2019s\xa0request to place\xa0<i>Clinton Cash: A Graphic Novel</i>\xa0on its shelves \u2014 a ban that occurred mere weeks before the start of <a href="/web/20161004124800/http://www.bannedbooksweek.org/">Banned Books Week</a>.</p>, <p>The graphic novel was always meant to convey the fact-based reporting found in\xa0<em>Clinton Cash</em>\xa0\u201cin a way that makes it accessible to people who don\u2019t have time to sit down and read a serious nonfiction book,\u201d\xa0<em>Clinton Cash\xa0</em>author and Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Peter\xa0Schweizer\xa0<a href="/web/20161004124800/http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/08/10/schweizer-graphic-novel-makes-clinton-cash-accessible-for-busy-millennials/" target="_blank">told\xa0<em>Fox &amp; Friends</em></a>\xa0in a recent interview.</p>, <p>\u201cI think millennials love this sort of approach because it\u2019s humorous,\u201d Schweizer said. \u201cThey put in humor. It\u2019s a lot of great visual images.\u201d</p>, <p>In an appearance in August on\xa0<a href="/web/20161004124800/http://www.breitbart.com/radio/2016/08/09/cartoonist-brett-smith-clinton-cash-a-graphic-novel-is-one-of-the-most-subversive-things-the-right-has-done-with-pop-culture/" target="_blank"><em>Breitbart News Daily\xa0</em>SiriusXM radio</a>, Smith, reiterating what Schweizer had said, said the book\u2019s form as a\xa0\u201csubversive\u201d message to young Americans is what initially attracted him to the project.</p>, <p>\u201cOne of the things that really attracted me to the project was it gave us an opportunity to do something really subversive \u2013 probably one of the most subversive things the Right has done when it comes to pop culture maybe since\xa0<em>Clinton Cash</em>, the documentary,\u201d Smith said. \u201cAnd of course, Andrew [Breitbart] always said that politics is downstream from culture. And I was really interested in seeing if we could make those two intersect. And I think we were able to do that in a crisp, engaging and new way with\xa0<em>Clinton Cash: A Graphic Novel</em>, and we do that through humor, which is also something which I think is new and cutting edge \u2013 definitely avant-garde for the Right \u2013 using satire and humor, parody, mockery.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cThe Right has not lost the culture war. The Right has almost ceded the culture war by not engaging, and I really wanted to use the Left\u2019s weapons back on them,\u201d Smith continued. \u201cIt\u2019s payback time. They don\u2019t own pop culture. They don\u2019t own it all. They don\u2019t own that territory, and we need to start taking it back. Jon Stewart just signed a four-year deal with HBO. He\u2019s got an animation studio geared up. He\u2019s got 3-D graphics cranking. We need to start fighting fire with fire and show up to the gunfight with a flamethrower.\u201d</p>, <p>Since its highly anticipated\xa0August 8 debut, the book sold out in less than 24 hours, forcing a second printing.</p>, <p><em>Clinton Cash: A Graphic Novel\xa0</em>is\xa0<a href="/web/20161004124800/https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1621575454/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1621575454&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=breitbart035-20&amp;linkId=d2c58e8d38b652de57e7847d6f28306a" target="_blank">available online</a>\xa0for purchase in\xa0<a href="/web/20161004124800/https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1621575454/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1621575454&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=breitbart035-20&amp;linkId=d2c58e8d38b652de57e7847d6f28306a" target="_blank">hardcover</a>\xa0and as an\xa0<a href="/web/20161004124800/https://www.amazon.com/Clinton-Cash-A-Graphic-Novel-ebook/dp/B01J0FTGVE/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=#nav-subnav" target="_blank">e-book</a>.</p>, <p>\xa0</p>, <p><em>Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter:\xa0<a href="/web/20161004124800/https://twitter.com/JeromeEHudson" target="_blank">@JeromeEHudson</a></em></p>]
