[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Compared with Hillary Clinton, his rival and the Democratic nominee for president who has all but abandoned the state as Trump takes the lead in polling, that\u2019s a significant amount. Clinton had trouble filling a small venue the last time she was in Colorado in early August.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">\u201cThe last time Hillary Clinton was in Colorado was in early August,\u201d Trump\u2019s Colorado state director Patrick Davis told Breitbart News on Sunday night. \u201cShe had trouble filling a high school auditorium in Commerce City. We expect thousands of people in Pueblo and tens of thousands in Loveland tomorrow.\u201d</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Colorado\u2019s nine electoral votes make it one of the most critical battleground states, and the last time a Republican won the state in the presidential election was George W. Bush in both 2000 and 2004. Barack Obama, the outgoing current Democratic president, won in both 2008 and 2012, defeating John McCain and Mitt Romney in those respective contests.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Trump will appear at 3 p.m. Mountain Time in Pueblo, about two hours south of Denver, and then at 6 p.m. Mountain Time in Loveland, about an hour north of Denver. While most in the legacy establishment media refuse to cover the people who come out to Trump rallies, Breitbart News will be on the ground to provide live coverage with photographs and videos with the crowd.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">\u201cIf you go to a Trump rally, you see it,\u201d Davis told Breitbart News about the clear enthusiasm gap that exists between Trump\u2019s energetic campaign rallies and Clinton\u2019s boring speech events. \u201cYou feel it. It\u2019s more rock concert than it is political rally.\u201d</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Trump, according to the <a href="/web/20161004165859/http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/co/colorado_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson_vs_stein-5974.html#polls" target="_blank">RealClearPolitics polling average</a>, has taken a slight lead in Colorado over Clinton of a half a percent with momentum at his back. The <a href="/web/20161004165859/http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/09/25/exclusive-breitbartgravis-polls-trump-takes-lead-colorado-maintains-lead-ohio/" target="_blank">latest Breitbart News Network/Gravis Marketing survey</a> from Colorado has Trump up four points over Clinton, just outside the survey\u2019s margin of error. Davis said it\u2019s a combination of developments that have led to Clinton\u2019s drop off in support in Colorado, and Trump\u2019s surge: She\u2019s not in the state, her campaign and the Democrats aren\u2019t airing television ads, and staff for Clinton and the Democrats are rushing out of Colorado as fast as they can. Mix that together with Trump\u2019s appeal on economic issues, immigration, the Iran deal, and healthcare policy, and you\u2019ve got a winning campaign in Colorado.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">\u201cI think it\u2019s two things: One is the strength of his message about the economy and jobs \u2014 Colorado\u2019s economy is actually humming along pretty well,\u201d Davis said:</span></p>, <p>I think his message to the voters of Colorado is \u201cyou like what you got now? Just wait until I become president. It will be rocking.\u201d The other thing that\u2019s helping is he\u2019s been here quite a bit. He\u2019s spending money here. We\u2019re on television here. We have a very good sized field staff and ground game going on here. You go to even a small Trump rally in a local field office, 200 or 300 people will show up \u2014 these are people you don\u2019t know. But there\u2019s a lot of energy in Colorado. On the other side of the fence, Hillary\u2019s campaign is all but dead here. She\u2019s not on television. You don\u2019t see phone banks filled. Actually, you see some staff leaving the state on the Democratic side. It does feel like they\u2019ve abandoned Colorado.</p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">When told of how the campaign of GOP senatorial nominee Darryl Glenn informed Breitbart News of the fact that the Iran deal, Obamacare, and immigration are frustrations voters here have with the status quo in Washington, D.C., Davis said: \u201cThey\u2019re right on.\u201d</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Glenn, a fellow outsider like Trump who\u2019s also seeing a surge in polling in the state as he runs against incumbent Democrat Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO), told Breitbart News in his own exclusive interview that he thinks this is an outsider\u2019s year. </span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">\u201cThe bottom line is whether it\u2019s the establishment or whatever, people are really tired of politicians saying one thing to get elected and then selling out to special interest groups and really not representing people,\u201d Glenn said in the interview, the full version of which is forthcoming.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">With regard to Obamacare specifically, Davis said, Coloradans are seeing their premiums go up and their plans go away. </span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">\u201cOn Obamacare, the problem in Colorado is that people are seeing their policies go away \u2014 be taken away \u2014 they\u2019re losing their coverage. And their premiums are skyrocketing in Colorado,\u201d Davis said. \u201cSo, people are being forced into Obamacare and they don\u2019t have any choices. So the quality of care, the quality of insurance, is going down.\u201d</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Davis added that the Department of Veterans Affairs, \u201cand how we treat our veterans,\u201d is certainly \u201cresonating here.\u201d</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">\u201cWe have a couple big high profile VA clinics here, one being in Aurora in Congressman Coffman\u2019s district that is a complete unmitigated disaster,\u201d Davis said:</span></p>, <p>The VA has completely screwed that up\u2014it\u2019s way over budget and it\u2019s still not finished. That is the poster child of the dysfunction at the VA, and it\u2019s right here in Colorado. If you\u2019re a veteran in Colorado and looking for healthcare, in some cases you wait for months. We don\u2019t have enough good doctors in the VA system to put our veterans in front of. Mr. Trump was here at the beginning of September and he proposed rolling out a program in Colorado Springs \u2014 or in Colorado in general \u2014 where we would give veterans a card and say \u201cgo find a doctor that will see you and can help you and we will pay for it,\u201d not keeping them tied into the VA system. Mr. Trump said he wanted to roll out that plan here in Colorado first, and that was widely well and positively received.</p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Trump\u2019s surge in the polls in Colorado is coinciding with some of the most vicious attacks that the Hillary Clinton campaign \u2014 and their allies in the legacy and establishment media in Washington, D.C., and in New York City \u2014 have levied against the businessman. Given the nature of Colorado voters \u2014 free-thinking and independent-minded with a disdain for elitists telling them how to think \u2014 that doesn\u2019t surprise Davis one bit. </span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">\u201cThe people of Colorado, all across the board \u2014 all types of voters, Republicans, Democrats, independents, libertarians, socialists, even Green Party \u2014 they are not cheap,\u201d Davis said:</span></p>, <p>We like to think for ourselves. We have a healthy suspicion of the mainstream media in Colorado and I think that\u2019s why you see people like Donald Trump doing very well here, because he treats individuals \u2014 voters of all types \u2014 like individuals. He doesn\u2019t treat people like \u201cAfrican Americans\u201d and \u201cHispanic Americans\u201d \u2014 he treats them like Americans. And he wants them to prosper individually and that message comes through loud and clear. I think people are open to listening to what Mr. Trump has to say here, not what is being said in the mainstream media.</p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Davis also predicted that Trump will intensify his efforts to reach out to Hispanic voters in the coming days.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">\u201cWe\u2019re going to hear a lot in the next couple of days about Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal to Hispanic Americans, and Hispanics in Colorado,\u201d Davis said: </span></p>, <p>In my experience, in the past couple of months \u2014 particularly after Trump\u2019s speech in Phoenix about immigration \u2014 the Hispanics in Colorado were telling me and were telling the campaign that he had given them some hope that the doorway wasn\u2019t closed for them to have a say in the immigration policy in a Trump administration. They took his speech as the beginning of conversation, not the closing of a door, and I think you\u2019re going to hear more of that in the coming days.</p>]
