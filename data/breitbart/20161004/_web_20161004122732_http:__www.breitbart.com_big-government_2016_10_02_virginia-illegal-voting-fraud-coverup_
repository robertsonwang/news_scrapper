[<p>\u201cVirginia election officials don\u2019t seem to care that thousands of [foreign] aliens have corrupted their voter rolls,\u201d by illegally registering to vote, said\xa0<a href="/web/20161004171455/https://publicinterestlegal.org/about-us/team/">J. Christian Adams,</a>\xa0the former Department of Justice lawyer, and now the president of the Public Interest Legal Foundation. \u201cEven worse than doing nothing about it, they are trying to cover it up,\u201d he told <em>Breitbart News</em>.</p>, <p>Even small amounts of illegal voting can make a decisive difference \u2014 Democratic Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring defeated Republican Mark Obenshain in 2013 by a mere 165 votes out of 2.2 million votes cast.</p>, <p>But \u201cin the eight [out of 130-plus] jurisdictions that provided us with lists of aliens recently removed from their voter rolls,\xa0we discovered that 31 non-citizens had cast a total of 186 votes between 2005 and 2015,\u201d said the report, given first to <em>Breitbart News.\xa0</em></p>, <p>\u201cThis is just a fraction of the aliens caught in just eight counties in a state with over 130 counties,\u201d Adams said. \u201cEven with such a small sample, the number of aliens who got on the voter rolls is staggering.\xa0The aliens are casting ballots in a state where elections have been decided by a few hundred votes.\u201d</p>, <p>The new report is a partnership of the <a href="/web/20161004171455/http://www.virginiavotersalliance.org/block-noncitizen-voters/">Virginia Voters Alliance </a>and the <a href="/web/20161004171455/https://publicinterestlegal.org/">Public Interest Legal Foundation</a>, and it details how at least 1,046 non-citizens were allowed to vote based on official voting records, he said.</p>, <p>State-wide, \u201cthe problem is most certainly exponentially worse [than seen in the eight localities] because we have no data regarding aliens on\xa0the registration rolls for the other 125 Virginia localities,\u201d the report said. \u201cWhen the\xa0voting history of this small sample of alien registrants is examined, nearly 200 verified ballots\xa0were cast before they were removed from the rolls. Each one of them is likely a felony.\u201d</p>, <p>The authors highlighted the role played by\xa0<a href="/web/20161004171455/http://www.elections.virginia.gov/contact-us/commissioner/edgardo-cortes.html">Edgardo Cort\xe9s</a>, the commissioner of the commonwealth\u2019s department of elections.</p>, <p>Before his appointment by Democratic Gov.

The law does not require any other evidence, and in several states, such as Alabama, Georgia and Kansas, the <a href="/web/20161004171455/http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2012/08/06/court-rules-doj-politicized-black-panther-case-awards-jw-court-fees/">Department of Justice</a> and or left-wing operatives have sought to block efforts to tighten citizenship verification.</p>, <p>But the<a href="/web/20161004171455/https://www.justice.gov/crt/national-voter-registration-act-1993-nvra"> Motor Voter law</a>\xa0also requires officials to maintain records and to strip ineligible voters from the rolls. So the voters\u2019 alliance asked officials for copies of voters\u2019 records to gauge their eligibility.</p>, <p>In January, the Virginia Voters Alliance requested City of Alexandria registrar Anna Leider to produce voter records, but Leider refused.</p>, <p>In April, the\xa0Public Interest Legal Foundation, on behalf of VVA and Alexandria citizen David Norcross, filed suit in federal court. When the case came to the courtroom, Leider promised the court she would allow VVA and Norcross to inspect her records\u2013an inspection, which revealed hundreds of non-citizens on the voter rolls. But, Leider\u2019s cooperation ended there, as she stopped the VVA representatives from making a photocopy of the list, according to the report\u2019s authors.</p>, <p>Eight months later, Leider\u2019s lawyer produced a list of just 70 aliens her office had removed from the rolls,\xa0according to the report.</p>, <p>Following this confirmation, <a href="/web/20161004171455/http://www.virginiavotersalliance.org/category/voter-fraud/">VVA</a> and PILF made similiar requests to 19 of the commonwealth\u2019s cities and counties: Arlington, Albemarle,\xa0Bedford,\xa0Chesterfield,\xa0Fairfax City,\xa0Fauquier,\xa0Frederick,\xa0Falls Church, \xa0Loudon, Hampton,\xa0Hanover,\xa0James City, Lancaster, Manassas, Prince William,\xa0Roanoke,\xa0Stafford,\xa0Rappahannock and\xa0York.</p>, <p>Election officials at Prince William County provided VVA with the names of 433 non-citizens, who had been registered to vote in the county, but had been later removed, the report said.</p>, <p>Barbara Gunter, the general registrar of Bedford County, which has roughly 60,000 voting age citizens, produced at list of 35 names of illegal voters on the rolls. She also gave up the names of additional 54 voters who were sent notices that they need to validate their eligibility.\xa0But soon after her response to VVA and PILF, Gunter called PILF requesting that they destroy the list.\xa0She asked for the list to be destroyed because<a href="/web/20161004171455/http://www.elections.virginia.gov/contact-us/commissioner/edgardo-cortes.html">\xa0Cort\xe9s</a>, the state elections commissioner, claimed she violated the federal Drivers Privacy Protection Act.</p>, <p>This process was repeated in Roanoke County, which produced a list 22 illegal voters. Then the county\u2019s\xa0General Registrar Judith Stokes emailed PILF to request the destruction of the list upon the guidance of\xa0<a href="/web/20161004171455/http://www.elections.virginia.gov/contact-us/commissioner/edgardo-cortes.html">Cort\xe9s</a>,\xa0according to the report.</p>, <p>Following Roanoke\u2019s email, all of the other 17 jurisdictions with pending requests for voter records contacted\xa0VVA and PILF to say that\xa0<a href="/web/20161004171455/http://www.elections.virginia.gov/contact-us/commissioner/edgardo-cortes.html">Cort\xe9s</a>\xa0told them not to honor the requests, each citing concerns for driver privacy, according to the report.</p>, <p>The report says the coverup was exposed when\xa0Cort\xe9s took his next step, which insist that all requests of voter records would be processed through his state office. Tn his own correspondence with VVA and PILF, the commissioner said his consolidation was meant to relieve local offices of the administrative burden and to ensure that individual\u2019s privacy concerns were addressed.</p>, <p>Cort\xe9s final\xa0offer to VVA and PILF is that he will promise to provide some information, but nothing relating to illegal voters and the purging of illegal voters.</p>, <p>Adams told <em>Breitbart News</em>, the abuses and cover up in Virginia is just the tip of the iceberg, not only in Virginia, but across the country.</p>, <p><a href="/web/20161004171455/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/11/us/politics/11voting.html">The voting rights attorney </a>said the VVA and PILF groups did their job by naming names, by citing the actions and inaction, of state and local election officials.</p>, <p>It is important to remember that the report describes violations of state and federal laws that have yet to be addressed by state and federal law enforcement, he said.</p>, <p>\u201cSoros fueled groups like the NAACP\u200e, Democrats and Advancement Project are in court now opposing citizenship verification measures,\u201d he said.</p>, <p>For years the Left has dismissed suspicions that non-citizens are voting, he said.\xa0\u201cNow, we know why,\u201d the lawyer said.</p>, <p>\u201cWhen an alien registers to vote, it is a felony,\u201d Adams said. \u201cWhen an alien votes, it is multiple felonies.
