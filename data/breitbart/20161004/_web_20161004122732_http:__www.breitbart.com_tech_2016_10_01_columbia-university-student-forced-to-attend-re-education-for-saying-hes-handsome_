[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweetwood was attending a Chinese language class in the fall of 2014. Naturally part of this class was using the vocabulary and grammar learned to create sentences. During one class Sweetwood referred to himself as handsome using the Chinese phrase, \u201cW\u01d2 h\u011bn shu\xe0i\u201d. Sweetwood thought nothing of this, finished the class and went home. The next day however Sweetwood was asked to stay after class by his professor, in Sweetwood\u2019s own words, this is how the exchange went.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cShe mentioned I had called myself handsome and alluded to my joking personality in general. She also told me she was not offended at all. She said she thought it was funny, but that she didn\u2019t want to get in trouble herself. She told me if I want to make those jokes, I should come to her office hours to do so. I assumed it\u2019s because my sick mind needed to be contained in a space where other students were not at risk of harm. I felt bad for the teacher as she seemed to be in a tough situation, where she had no choice but to scold me.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweetwood received an email from Columbia University\u2019s dean later in the day informing him that he had been reported to the \u201cGender-Based Misconduct Office\u201d and would need to meet with the dean as soon as possible. Sweetwood did meet with the dean who attempted to make him admit fault in the situation, Sweetwood refused.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cMy dean tried to make me agree that I would never do this again. I flat out refused. I laid into her about how upset I was about the situation and I said something along the lines of: \u2018If you\u2019re asking me to not be myself, then I guarantee I will end up back in your office again.\u2019\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dean did however seem to concede that the reaction to Sweetwoods comments may have been over the top, at one point saying, \u201cEven if I agree with you, I obviously couldn\u2019t say anything\u2026\u201d.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This eventually led to Sweetwood being forced to discuss the matter with a caseworker from the Gender-Based Misconduct Office who set up a \u201cre-education\u201d meeting in his office. Once Sweetwood explained what happened and his general views on gender based attacks and homophobia, the caseworker seemed to lighten up, once again echoing the deans sentiment saying, \u201cEven if I were to agree with you, you know I can\u2019t say anything\u2026\u201d.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case was eventually dismissed but Sweetwood didn\u2019t miss his chance to let the classmate that reported him know how he felt about the situation.\xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cLater that week, in Chinese class when my teacher was having us use a new sentence structure to talk about things that make us upset, my sentence was: \u201cI get upset when I get reported to Gender Misconduct by my classmates (OK, I may have used a little bit of English to get the full phrase out). I probably shouldn\u2019t have done that but it was just too damn funny not to.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read Sweetwood\u2019s full article at </span><a href="/web/20161004060637/http://thetab.com/us/columbia/2016/10/01/i-was-reported-for-gender-misconduct-for-calling-myself-handsome-in-class-2611"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tab here.</span></a></p>, <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucas Nolan is a conservative who regularly contributes articles on censorship and free speech to Breitbart.
