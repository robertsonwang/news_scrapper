[<p>Facebook, which runs on a series of complex algorithms and systems, tends to ensure that users see more of what they like and what their friends like, as opposed to different opinions and viewpoints from elsewhere.</p>, <p>CNN <a href="/web/20161004123441/http://www.journalism.org/2015/06/01/facebook-top-source-for-political-news-among-millennials/">came just behind Facebook for news for millennials at 44%</a>, followed by local TV at 37%, and Google News, <a href="/web/20161004123441/http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/09/13/hillary-google-bias-confirmed-experiment/">the search engine that has frequently been linked to a pro-Hillary Clinton bias</a>, at 33%.</p>, <p>Generation Xers also placed Facebook at the top of their news list, with 51% of people choosing it as their primary news platform. This was followed by local TV at 46% and CNN at 45%.</p>, <p>Only 39% of Baby Boomers listed Facebook as their primary news platform, preferring local TV at 60% and mainstream media outlets NBC and Fox at 47%.</p>, <p>\u201cHBO host John Oliver achieved the destruction of Donald Trump on 29 February 2016. At least,\xa0according to the Daily Beast,\u201d <a href="/web/20161004123441/https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/01/millennials-facebook-politics-bias-social-media?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_reddit_is_fun">wrote Scott Bixby for the Guardian on Saturday</a>. \u201cFansided, a popular social news aggregator, dates Trump\u2019s destruction at 1 August while\xa0the Daily Good\xa0called it for 21 March. Salon found no fewer than\u201c13 glorious times\u201d\xa0that Oliver had destroyed the real estate tycoon.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cSharp-eyed consumers of the news might note that it is impossible to, as the dictionary says, \u2018put an end to the existence of something\u2019 more than a single time,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut for #NeverTrump Facebook users who love any content they see as bringing Trump down a peg, the formulaic headline is indicative of the\xa0Facebook media landscape: the most shareable, clickable and likable content on the site aligns strongly with its readership\u2019s pre-existing biases, assumptions and political affiliation.\u201d</p>, <p>Bixby, who based his article on the Pew Research report, concluded that millennials are most likely to be in a huge echo chamber, listing the high popularity and share-factor of videos on politically biased pages such as Occupy Democrats and The Other 98%, and the high number of left-wing users who unfriend people if they have different political views.</p>, <p>\u201cFor millennials who have never known an election without Facebook, the political landscape of the social media network has massive implications for the upcoming contest between\xa0Hillary Clinton\xa0and Trump \u2013 not least of which because of Facebook\u2019s outsized influence on their exposure to political news,\u201d claimed Bixby. \u201cUnlike Twitter \u2013 or real life \u2013 where interaction with those who disagree with you on political matters is an inevitability, Facebook users can block, mute and unfriend any outlet or person that will not further bolster their current worldview.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cFacebook is, after all, a reflection of its users\u2019 wants and behavior,\u201d he concluded. \u201cIt\u2019s not Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s fault people seek out like-minded news sources to buttress their political beliefs.\u201d</p>, <p><i>Charlie Nash is a reporter\xa0for\xa0Breitbart Tech.
