[<p>Tiger Woods kept a low profile, save for his garish sunglasses, all week as he is working his way back into polite society. He barely spoke at the press conference and kept his celebrations low key. We\u2019ll see if a humbled Tiger plays better golf but I think his years of competing for major championships are over.</p>, <p><a href="/web/20161004060118/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/09/Tiger-Woods-at-Ryder-Cup-2016.jpg"><img alt="Tiger Woods at Ryder Cup 2016" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5148056" height="481" src="/web/20161004060118im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/09/Tiger-Woods-at-Ryder-Cup-2016.jpg" width="640"/></a></p>, <p>America needs to come up with better chants. The hokey \u201cI believe that we will win\u201d chant was monotonous and caused eye rolls from many in the crowd. And as a patriot, I love hearing \u201cThe Star Spangled Banner\u201d sung proudly\u2026..but not every 20 minutes.</p>, <p><a href="/web/20161004060118/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/10/Ryder-Cup-Crowd-2016-1-e1475511954815.jpg"><img alt="Ryder Cup Crowd 2016" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5170621" height="480" src="/web/20161004060118im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/10/Ryder-Cup-Crowd-2016-1-e1475511954815.jpg" width="640"/></a></p>, <p>Rory McIlroy had the misfortune of dealing with hecklers on almost every single hole from his introduction Friday on the first tee where a few spectators yelled out \u201cRory is short\u201d to a psychotic fan running up to him Saturday between the seventh and eighth green and yelling, \u201cSuck a d***, Rory!\u201d Whatever happened to Minnesota nice? Idiotic golf fans have been getting away with shouting \u201cbababooey\u201d and \u201cmashed potato\u201d after every tee shot. It\u2019s regressed from this silliness to the vile, vulgar insults a class act endured this weekend. Sad.</p>, <p><a href="/web/20161004060118/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/10/Rory-in-Sand-Ryder-Cup-2016-1-e1475512688592.jpg"><img alt="Rory in Sand Ryder Cup 2016" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5170736" height="480" src="/web/20161004060118im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/10/Rory-in-Sand-Ryder-Cup-2016-1-e1475512688592.jpg" width="640"/></a></p>, <p>Mike Eruzione of 1980 USA Hockey fame is certainly wringing every bit of celebrity out of that game played 36 years ago. Good for him, I guess. He was a featured guest and walked 18 holes with Phil Mickelson. He chose to wear black leather penny loafers with no socks\u2014a strange choice when you\u2019re going to walk 18 holes.</p>, <p><a href="/web/20161004060118/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/10/Mike-Eruziones-Shoes-Ryder-Cup.jpg"><img alt="Mike Eruzione's Shoes Ryder Cup" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5170656" height="480" src="/web/20161004060118im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/10/Mike-Eruziones-Shoes-Ryder-Cup.jpg" width="640"/></a></p>, <p>Warning to those who plan to attend a Ryder Cup in the future. Don\u2019t expect to see much golf. With the immense crowds and the fact that on Friday and Saturday there are only four groups out at a time, you just don\u2019t get to see many golf shots. It\u2019s not like a regular tournament where there is play on every hole. That said, the spirit and camaraderie of the event makes waiting around enjoyable.</p>, <p><em>Dan Redmond can be found on twitter @danfromdc</em></p>]
