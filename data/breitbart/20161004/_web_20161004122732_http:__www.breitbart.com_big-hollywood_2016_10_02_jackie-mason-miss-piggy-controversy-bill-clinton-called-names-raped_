[<p>Stated Mason:</p>, <p>\u201cWhat Trump ever did to women is that he called them a name because she gained too much weight so he said she got too fat and he called her a pig. Imagine if the worst thing Bill Clinton ever did was call a girl a name. He called them names after he raped them.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cWhen he got through with them, Juanita Broaddrick wound up with a cut lip. And he had advised her to please go see a doctor. He was very compassionate about sending them to doctors. But he wasn\u2019t too concerned about beating them up in the first place. He was so busy punching them around that nobody knows if he made love to them or he just wanted to beat them up a little bit.\u201d</p>, <p>Mason was speaking during his regular segment on this reporter\u2019s talk radio program, \u201c<a href="/web/20161004124755/http://www.connectpal.com/aaronklein">Aaron Klein Investigative Radio</a>,\u201d broadcast on New York\u2019s AM 970 The Answer and NewsTalk 990 AM in Philadelphia.</p>, <p>Mason also sounded off\xa0about Hillary Clinton\u2019s alleged treatment of her husband\u2019s purported assault victims:</p>, <p>\u201cHe was really a violent, insane character. Now his wife, she had a job. Her job was to make sure that these women were never heard about it. Every time somebody threatened to talk about it she immediately went to work on destroying them. First he punched them around. Then it was her job to wipe them out altogether.</p>, <p>\u2026And she\u2019s calling Trump a person who can\u2019t be trusted because of the way he treats women? This is like somebody who crossed a red light being compared to a murderer.\u201d</p>, <p><em>Jackie Mason will be <a href="/web/20161004124755/http://www.box-officetickets.com/Events/Comedy-Tickets/Jackie-Mason/2035230?utm_source=bing&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=EventsVivid_412_Count%20Basie%20Theatre_Red%20Bank_NJ_US&amp;utm_term=%2Bjackie%20%2Bmason%20%2Bred%20%2Bbank&amp;utm_content=Artist_2035230_Jackie%20Mason_10%2F9%2F2016">performing</a> October 9 at the Count Basie Theatre in\xa0Red Bank, NJ.</em></p>, <p><i><b>Aaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.
