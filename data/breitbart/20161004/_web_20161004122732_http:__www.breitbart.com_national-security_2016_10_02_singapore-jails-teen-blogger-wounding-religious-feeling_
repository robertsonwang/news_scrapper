[<p>Such was the pronouncement of district judge Ong Hian Sun, according to CNN, which reports Yee was facing six charges of \u201cwounding religious feeling\u201d with his social media posts \u2014 he has a preference for YouTube rants. He was also slapped with two charges of failing to report to the police station when summoned.</p>, <p>This wasn\u2019t the first time Yee\u2019s YouTube videos got him in trouble. A 2015 rant in which he called the late Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew a \u201ctotalitarian\u201d and compared him to Chairman Mao, Stalin, Hitler, and Jesus Christ, brought a three-week prison sentence, which was ultimately commuted to time served.</p>, <p>As the <a href="/web/20161004160156/https://cpj.org/2015/03/singapore-blogger-jailed-for-critical-lee-kuan-yew.php?utm_content=buffer08956&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer">Committee to Protect Journalists</a> noted at the time, it was evidently Lee\u2019s religious comments in that earlier video that brought him the most trouble. One of the charges against him was \u201cdeliberate intention of wounding the religious or racial feelings of any person,\u201d which sounds like essentially the same statute he was just imprisoned for.</p>, <p>This time, he pleaded guilty to the charges\xa0and told CNN in a phone interview that he considered his sentence a \u201cgood deal,\u201d since he could have faced up to six years in prison.</p>, <p>\u201cI think that if I do continue to make critical social media posts I\u2019ll post things that aren\u2019t illegal. I think that will be possible,\u201d Yee said.</p>, <p><a href="/web/20161004160156/http://tribune.com.pk/story/1190709/singapore-rebel-teen-jailed-anti-religion-posts/">AFP</a> quotes him telling reporters after his court appearance that \u201cyou can be sent to jail for criticising Islam in Singapore even if you\u2019re a kid.\u201d</p>, <p>In the AFP piece, Phil Robertson of Human Rights Watch castigated Singapore, saying that \u201cby prosecuting Amos Yee for his comments, no matter how outrageous they may have been, Singapore has unfortunately doubled down on a strategy that clearly violates freedom of expression.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cFor a country that prides itself on efficiency, Singapore should re-examine its approach, because every time the authorities go after him, it just adds to his online audience who are interested to find out the latest thing he said,\u201d Robertson added.</p>, <p>Actually, intimidating people out of speaking\xa0could be<em>\xa0</em>an efficient approach to suppressing expression \u2014 it matters little how many fans await Yee\u2019s next transgressive YouTube video if he\u2019s afraid to make them.</p>, <p>The Singapore\xa0<em><a href="/web/20161004160156/http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/amos-yee-jailed-6-weeks-fined-2k">Straits Times</a>\xa0</em>quotes a defense lawyer stating that Yee \u201cadmits he does not possess any religious, scholastic, and/or intellectual ability to discuss religion,\u201d and that his \u201ccontemptuous and vituperative language\u201d shows his \u201cshallowness of his thoughts in respect of both Christianity and Islam.\u201d</p>]
