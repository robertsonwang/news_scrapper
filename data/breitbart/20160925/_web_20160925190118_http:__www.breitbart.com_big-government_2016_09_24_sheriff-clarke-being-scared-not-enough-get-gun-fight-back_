[<p>Speaking live to Fox News\u2019 Neil Cavuto\xa0on September 24, Clarke stated:</p>, <p>This is the world we live in now, [and Americans] are scared, but being scared is not enough. I say, you can hide under the bed, you can do all this other stuff, but you can fight back. And the more these individuals, these perpetrators, realize that somebody is going to quickly be able to counter their nonsense, I think you\u2019ll see less [of these attacks]. If nothing else, you\u2019ll be able to play a role in saving your own life.</p>, <p>Clarke said that as things now stand, attackers pick soft targets and \u201cknow that they\u2019ll be able to shed a lot of blood before the situation is stopped.\u201d He said Americans need to \u201cwake up and get out of this naive view that the police will be able to protect everybody all the time.\u201d He talked about Public Safety Announcements (PSAs) he runs in Milwaukee County, reminding residents that \u201cthey are the front line in their own security.\u201d</p>, <p>Clarke began running the self-defense PSAs in January 2013, while Democrat leaders in Washington, D.C., were using the Sandy Hook Elementary School attack to push more gun control on law-abiding citizens.</p>, <p>On January 25, 2013, the <em><a href="/web/20160925134706/http://archive.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/sheriff-clarke-urges-residents-to-arm-themselves-with-guns-o38h47h-188375091.html">Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</a></em> reported that the PSA featured Clarke emphasizing\xa0that waiting on police was no longer a valid option, that citizens needed to get \u201cin the game.\u201d He added, \u201cWith officers laid off and furloughed, simply calling 911 and waiting is no longer your best option.\xa0You could beg for mercy from a violent criminal, hide under the bed, or you can fight back.\u201d He urged residents to take a firearm safety course and familiarize themselves with their guns so they could defend their lives until police arrived.</p>, <p>Clarke added, \u201cYou have a duty to protect yourself and your family. We\u2019re partners now.\u201d</p>, <p><em>AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
