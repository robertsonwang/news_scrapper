[<p>Newspapers around the world sympathetically reported the plight of 23-year-old Australian Muslim university student\xa0Zeynab Alshelh\xa0this week after images emerged which purported to show her being harrassed on a French beach.</p>, <p>British titles including the <a href="/web/20160925134433/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/18/burkini-clad-australian-woman-chased-off-french-beach/">Daily Telegraph</a>, <a href="/web/20160925134433/https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1806212/moment-muslim-woman-is-forced-off-french-riviera-beach-for-wearing-burkini-in-protest-over-clothing-ban/">Sun</a>, <a href="/web/20160925134433/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-37382318">BBC</a>, <a href="/web/20160925134433/http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/muslim-woman-chased-french-beach-8865375">Mirror</a>, and others reported Ms. Alshelh had been \u201cchased off\u201d the beach, while she and her family were \u201cmet with abuse\u201d.</p>, <p>Yet calls for the young Muslim activist to issue an apology to France for her deliberately provocative stunt are growing after claims that the anger of those on the beach wasn\u2019t directed at the woman\u2019s attire \u2014 but at the presence of television cameras, in clear breach of French privacy laws.</p>, <p>The <em>Daily Mail Australia</em> <a href="/web/20160925134433/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3805126/Muslims-burkinis-provoked-French-locals-racist-reaction-STUNT-Seven-Network.html">reports</a> the remarks of an eye witness to the confrontation, who said: \u201cThe man on the video who said, \u2018You turn around and you leave\u2019, was my uncle. He never asked these three people to leave the beach. He spoke to the camera because he was asking the cameraman to leave.</p>, <p>\u201cThere were children on the beach, including our own, and we didn\u2019t want them to be filmed\u201d.</p>, <p>These claims stand in sharp contrast to Alshelh\u2019s claims on her Channel Seven show when she recounted per experience in France, where she had travelled expressly to protest the so-called Burka ban:</p>, <p>\u201cWe were threatened by locals to leave the beach and if we didn\u2019t they were going to call the police. They weren\u2019t happy with us being there, even though it was on the beach that the burkini ban was overturned but the locals were not happy\u201d.</p>, <p>The apparent duplicity of the activist has led\xa0<em>The Australian</em> , the nation\u2019s best selling <a href="/web/20160925134433/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/inquirer/seven-and-its-burkini-family-owe-france-an-apology/news-story/212b97b26ad5858a2421523dde546dec">newspaper</a> to state in an op-ed this weekend: \u201cThe Seven Network and the pugnacious Muslim Aussie family it flew to the French Riviera with the aim of provoking beachgoers into a \u201cracist\u201d reaction to the \u201cAussie cossie\u201d burkini owe the traumatised people of Nice and France a swift apology\u201d.</p>, <p>The newspaper said the footage had been selectively edited and distorted in order to reach \u201cpredetermined conclusions\u201d. The paper called the exercise unethical, and \u201cthe latest example of calculated French-bashing fuelled by collusion between the goals of political Islam and compliant media outlets seeking culture clash cliches\u201d.</p>, <p>While the Television report on Australia\u2019s Channel Seven suggested a man telephoning the police was making a complaint about the presence of women wearing so-called burkinis, he was actually reporting the presence of television cameras.</p>, <p>French law \u2014 in contrast to Australian \u2014 makes it an offence to photograph or film members of the public without their knowledge and consent. The application of these laws has recently been <a href="/web/20160925134433/http://www.breitbart.com/news/french-dancer-fined-for-selfie-with-snoozing-far-right-le-pen/">tested</a> when founder of the populist-right Front National party was photographed while sleeping on an aeroplane, leading to a token fine for the transgressor.</p>, <p>\xa0</p>]
