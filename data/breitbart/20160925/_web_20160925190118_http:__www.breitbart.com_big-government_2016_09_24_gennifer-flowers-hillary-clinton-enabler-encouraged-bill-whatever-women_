[<p>Flowers found herself back in the headlines Saturday when Donald Trump <a href="/web/20160925141905/http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/09/24/trump-threatens-seat-former-bill-clinton-mistress-front-row-debate/">threatened</a> on Twitter to bring her to the first presidential debate after Trump troll Mark Cuban said he\u2019d sit in the\xa0front-row. Flowers responded promptly on social media, <a href="/web/20160925141905/http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/09/24/trump-threatens-seat-former-bill-clinton-mistress-front-row-debate/">writing</a>, \u201cHi Donald Trump\u2026 I\u2019m in your corner. Of course I will see u at the debate !!\u201d</p>, <p>Besides Monical Lewinsky, Flowers has the distinction of being the only other woman with whom Bill Clinton has admitted to having had a sexual encounter outside of his marriage.</p>, <p>In a <a href="/web/20160925141905/http://www.wnd.com/2015/10/hillary-nightmare-gennifers-back/">wide-ranging interview</a> last October on my Sunday night talk radio show \u201c<a href="/web/20160925141905/http://www.connectpal.com/aaronklein">Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,</a>\u201d Flowers slammed Hillary\u2019s attempt to frame her campaign in part around women\u2019s issues as \u201ca joke.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cWoman\u2019s rights. Ha!\u201d Flowers stated. \u201cI personally have worked my tail off to get where I am in the entertainment business, which has not been easy since the Clinton scandal, by the way. \u2026 Hillary never put up a shingle and worked for her clients and built her clientele. She always got things on the back of her husband. \u2026 I think it\u2019s a joke that she would run on women\u2019s issues.\u201d</p>, <p>She continued: \u201cYou know, people criticize me for talking about her because I had an affair with her husband.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t blame them for that. I understand that. I understand that they can be mad at me. I get it. I accept my responsibility. \u2026 But she\u2019s never accepted her responsibility at being an enabler. She\u2019s been an enabler that has encouraged him to go out and do whatever he does with women.\u201d</p>, <p>Ominously, Flowers said\xa0at the time\xa0she believes it is a legitimate campaign issue to bring up Bill Clinton\u2019s past treatment of women.</p>, <p>\u201cMonica and I are the only two women that Bill has admitted to. I don\u2019t know the other ladies personally. Perhaps their stories are legitimate. I don\u2019t know that.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cBut just because we are women doesn\u2019t make our stories less important. Our stories should come back up with the circumstances, with Hillary running. It should come back to the forefront again.\u201d</p>, <p><i><b>Aaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.
