[<p>The poll seems to represent a stunning\xa0rebuke of the trade agenda of Washington leaders in both political parties, and may portend poorly for Hillary Clinton, who has a long record of being a vocal advocate of global trade.</p>, <p>The poll \u201cshows an across-the-board skepticism toward international trade,\u201d <em>Politico</em> <a href="/web/20160925143441/http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/politico-harvard-poll-free-trade-trump-gop-228600">writes</a>. By a five-to-one margin, Americans believe that trade policies with other countries have lost American jobs (65% believe our trade policies have lost the U.S. jobs versus only 13% who believe our trade policies have created U.S. jobs).</p>, <p>By a nearly four-to-one margin, Americans believe our trade policies have lowered rather than raised wages. Only 14% of Americans believe our trade policies have raised U.S. wages. The poll found that only a vanishing \u201c8% of Republicans, 11% of Independents, and 19% of Democrats think free trade has led to higher wages for U.S. workers.\u201d</p>, <p>A majority of those in the Midwest (53%) said free trade agreements have hurt\xa0their communities\u2014this included important electoral states like Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin.</p>, <p>During the Democratic primary, Bernie Sanders repeatedly attacked Clinton for her position on trade\xa0and accused Clinton of having \u201cvoted for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions, millions of jobs.\u201d</p>, <p>The latest POLITICO Pro-Harvard poll seems to confirm reports that have highlighted\xa0Clinton\u2019s vulnerability on the issue of trade. For instance, earlier this year, the liberal, anti-Trump\xa0<em>Huffington Post</em>\xa0published an article which seemed concerned that Trump\u2019s position on trade could deliver him to victory against Clinton.</p>, <p>\u201cOne of Donald Trump\u2019 main elements of appeal to his voters \u2013<em>\xa0if not the main appeal</em>\xa0\u2013 is his stance on trade and bringing jobs back to America. It is a winning message and Clinton is waaaayyyy behind the curve on this,\u201d Dave Johnson, a fellow at Campaign for America\u2019s Future, <a href="/web/20160925143441/http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/04/25/liberal-panic-huffpo-worries-trump-will-trounce-clinton-trade/">wrote</a> in the\xa0<em>Huffington Post</em>.</p>, <p>Moreover, the POLITICO Pro-Harvard poll also seems to present troubling data for the Clinton camp regarding Clinton\u2019s strategy of\xa0campaigning as President Obama\u2019s third term. The poll found that most Americans do not think the U.S. economy has improved after eight years of Obama\u2019s presidency. \u201cA majority (56%) of Americans think the U.S. economy has either stayed the same (24%) or gotten worse (32%) since the 2008 economic downturn,\u201d the report states. \u201cA majority also believes it has gotten harder for both lower- and middle- income people to get ahead financially.\u201d</p>, <p><em>Politico</em> notes that the poll is \u201can ominous sign for TPP, in particular.\u201d \xa0While less than a third of Americans \u201csay they have heard or read <em>anything</em>\u201d about the Trans Pacific Partnership agreement, \u201camong those who have heard of it, 63% are opposed and 68% think it should not be voted on until the new Congress comes into office after the lame-duck session.\u201d</p>, <p>While Clinton now claims to oppose TPP is in its current form, reports have documented how Clinton <a href="/web/20160925143441/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-01-10/how-hillary-clinton-created-a-u-s-business-promotion-machine">played</a> a \u201cleading part in drafting the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\u201d CNN has <a href="/web/20160925143441/http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/15/politics/45-times-secretary-clinton-pushed-the-trade-bill-she-now-opposes/">documented</a> that Clinton is on the record\xa0as\xa0having praised or promoted the TPP at least 45 times\u2014previously describing the deal as the \u201cgold standard.\u201d Moreover, in a Wednesday CNBC interview, Bill Clinton <a href="/web/20160925143441/http://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/21/bill-clinton-supports-lower-corporate-tax-rate-says-reasoning-for-tpp-clear.html">said</a> that the case for approval of TPP is \u201cclear.\u201d</p>, <p>The poll\u2019s findings regarding\xa0Republican voters are\xa0particularly remarkable.</p>, <p>The poll found that an astounding 85% of Republicans believe that so-called \u201cfree trade\u201d has lost more U.S. jobs than it has created\u2014a majority of Democrats (54%) and Independents (66%) agree with that sentiment. Additionally, 66% of Republicans and 50% of Independents believe that free trade has lowered U.S. wages.</p>, <p>By a nearly three-to-one margin, Republicans believe free trade agreements have \u201churt\u201d their community rather than helped it (47% say free trade has hurt their community versus 18% who say it has helped their community).</p>, <p>These\xa0findings suggest that Republican voters are\xa0overwhelmingly rejecting the views of their party\u2019s leaders in Washington, such as the trade agenda of House Speaker Paul Ryan.</p>, <p>Ryan has a long record of being a vocal advocate for global trade, despite the fact that\u2013as the new\xa0POLITICO\xa0poll shows\u2013nearly 9 in 10 of the voters Ryan\xa0is supposed to represent\xa0believe that these so-called \u201cfree trade\u201d deals have cost the U.S. more jobs than they\xa0have created.</p>, <p>\u201cA large majority of Republicans are repudiating their party\u2019s traditional support for free trade, and falling sharply in line with nominee Donald Trump\u2019s insistence that trade costs Americans more jobs than it creates,\u201d <em>Politico </em>notes.</p>, <p>Economist\xa0Peter Navarro, who is now a senior policy advisor to the Trump campaign, told <em>Politico</em> that Republican voters have long agreed with the position on trade\xa0now championed by Trump, but that Republican party leaders and donors refused to champion\xa0the views\xa0of their party\u2019s voters. \u201cThere\u2019s been a schism for a long time between registered Republicans and the party leadership,\u201d Navarro said. \u201cThat was the essence of the primary election. You had a group of insider politicians singing the same old globalization song. And one candidate saying the emperor has no clothes.\u201d</p>]
