[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">MONTERREY, Nuevo Leon \u2014 The kidnapping of a seven-year-old U.S. citizen by three gunmen set off a large scale rescue operation. The search was carried out by Mexican state and local law enforcement officials who coordinated with the FBI and personnel from the U.S. Embassy. The child was later found safe and unharmed.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">The child\u2019s mother, Patricia Renteria Martinez, told agents with the Nuevo Leon Attorney General\u2019s Office that she was on her way to a local elementary school in the town of El Carmen. A\xa0Jeep Patriot cut her off on the way to the school. Three men dressed in black jumped out of the vehicle, at least one of them was carrying a firearm. The kidnappers took the child and fled the area at a high rate of speed.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">The distraught 34-year-old mother said she began calling out for help and contacting law enforcement while her two daughters stayed inside her Pontiac Aztek SUV.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="/web/20160926161031/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/09/kidnapped-child-3.jpg"><img alt="kidnapped child 3" class="size-full wp-image-5107022 aligncenter" height="419" src="/web/20160926161031im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/09/kidnapped-child-3.jpg" width="640"/></a></span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Moments after the kidnapping, Renteria received a phone call from a man who identified himself as a a member from a drug cartel that operates in another state. The kidnapper demanded a large unspecified quantity of money from the woman. The name of the drug cartel that the kidnapper mentions was not provided by law enforcement. </span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">The kidnapping of the young U.S. citizen set of a large search operation where even the Nuevo Le\xf3n Attorney General Roberto Flores and the Public Safety Secretary Cuahutemoc Antunez made an appearance. The two public officials had not been seen out of their office in recent weeks even though the state has seen a wave of executions and armed robberies.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="/web/20160926161031/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/09/Kidnapped-Child-4.jpg"><img alt="Kidnapped Child 4" class="size-full wp-image-5107026 aligncenter" height="480" src="/web/20160926161031im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/09/Kidnapped-Child-4.jpg" width="640"/></a></span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Flores said that agents with the Fuerza Civil state police force and local police began a search and rescue operation. Upon learning that the child was a U.S. citizen, they contacted the FBI and notified the U.S. Embassy. </span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Flores confirmed that approximately six hours after the kidnapping, the criminal dropped off the child unharmed at a shopping mall in the town<span class="Apple-converted-space">\xa0 </span>of Salinas Victoria.<span class="Apple-converted-space">\xa0 </span>A group of local police officers spotted the child and took him to a local state run shelter.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="/web/20160926161031/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/09/Kidnapped-child-.jpg"><img alt="Kidnapped child" class="size-full wp-image-5107014 aligncenter" height="960" src="/web/20160926161031im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/09/Kidnapped-child-.jpg" width="640"/></a></span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the investigation, authorities determined that the child\u2019s mother had spent three years in prison and has a criminal history dating back to 2014 in connection with organized crime charges. The woman was arrested with money and drugs alongside her husband, a dangerous Los Zetas cartel boss whose power grew in recent years after a brazen prison escape in Apodaca.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="/web/20160926161031/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/09/Kidnapped-child-2.jpg"><img alt="Kidnapped child 2" class="size-full wp-image-5107018 aligncenter" height="427" src="/web/20160926161031im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/09/Kidnapped-child-2.jpg" width="640"/></a></span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Law enforcement sources identified the child\u2019s stepfather and current husband of the woman as Jose Isidro \u201cEl Pichilo\u201d Cruz Villarreal. The man known as Pichilo was the regional leader for Los Zetas in seven municipalities in Nuevo Leon. Currently, Cruz Villarreal is in prison in connection with a kidnapping charge even though originally he had been accused of ordering the murder of 17 members of a musical group called Kombo Kolombia. </span><span class="s1">One of the working theories of\xa0law enforcement is that the kidnapping was a revenge of sorts or some other issue tied to drug trafficking. </span></p>, <p><i>Editor\u2019s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Le\xf3n to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.\xa0 The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used.\xa0</i><a href="/web/20160926161031/http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2015/02/15/breitbart-texas-announces-cartel-chronicles-effort-begins-to-help-citizen-journalists-in-mexico/"><span class="s2"><i>Breitbart Texas\u2019 Cartel Chronicles</i></span></a><i>\xa0are published in both English and in their original\xa0</i><a href="/web/20160926161031/http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2015/02/15/cronicas-de-carteles-breitbart-texas-un-esfuerzo-por-ayudar-a-los-periodistas-de-ciudadanos-en-mexico/"><span class="s2"><i>Spanish</i></span></a><i>.
