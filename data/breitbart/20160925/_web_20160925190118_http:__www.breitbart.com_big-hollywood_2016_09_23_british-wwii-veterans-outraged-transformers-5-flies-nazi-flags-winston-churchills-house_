Richard Kemp, a former commander of British forces in Afghanistan, said that Churchill \u201cwill be turning in his grave\u201d over the incident.</p>, <p>\u201cI know it\u2019s a film, but it\u2019s symbolically disrespectful to Churchill,\u201d he said.</p>, <p>Blenheim Palace was built in the early 18th century and was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987. Jamie Spencer-Churchill, the 12th Duke of Marlborough, currently resides there, and the palace has reportedly been used as a filming location for several recent films, including the James Bond film <em>Spectre</em> and Disney\u2019s live-action <em>Cinderella</em>.</p>, <p class="wp-caption-text">A physical training class in progress in the open air in the great court at Blenheim Palace, with the superb fa\xe7ade of the Palace as a background in an undated photo.
