[<p>It is significant that a mainstream liberal publication is pointing out the problem, considering that Democrats are supposed to have a firm stranglehold on the emotions of the radical liberal youth. But perhaps Clinton, seen by many as the face of the establishment, is not radical enough for them.</p>, <p><em>Newsweek</em>\xa0<a href="/web/20160925042914/http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/09/17/politico-admits-voters-ditching-hillary-gary-johnson-jill-stein/">points to polling</a> that shows Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein are siphoning votes away from Clinton among the youth, which helps Trump.</p>, <p><a href="/web/20160925042914/http://www.newsweek.com/hillary-clinton-millennial-voters-502298"><em>Newsweek</em>\u2018s Emmett Rensin opines</a>:</p>, <p>Hillary Clinton <a href="/web/20160925042914/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNhEewwYtz4">does not support single-payer health care</a>; Young voters do. Hillary Clinton is among the more hawkish members of the Democratic Party; Young voters are not. Hillary Clinton is a capitalist, and even within a capitalist party, she is in both perception and in practice unusually comfortable with capitalism\u2019s worst practices. Millennials, by contrast, <a href="/web/20160925042914/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/04/26/a-majority-of-millennials-now-reject-capitalism-poll-shows/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reject the entire economic system</a> by a bare majority. They are no great fans of financial institutions or free trade. \xa0This should not be surprising in a year when <a href="/web/20160925042914/http://www.newsweek.com/election-2016-unpopularity-contest-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-501281">very few voters of any age group are particularly enthusiastic</a> about their prospects\u2026</p>, <p>\u2026Despite Clinton\u2019s flagging numbers, her chances of success remain high. Rather, the fear is that if younger voters really are committed to a host of ideological positions at odds with the mainstream of the Democratic Party, then that Party, without a Trump-sized cudgel, is doomed. It should not escape anybody\u2019s notice that politics by negative definition\u2014the argument, at bottom, that \u201cwe\u2019re better than those guys\u201d\u2014has become the dominant electoral strategy of the Democratic Party, and that despite the escalation of the \u201cthose guys\u201d negatives, the mere promise to be preferable has yielded diminishing returns. At some point, the Democratic Party will either need to embrace a platform significantly to the left of their current orthodoxy, or they will lose.</p>, <p>There are only so many times one can insist that young voters capitulate to a political party\u2019s sole demand\u2014vote for us!\u2014in exchange for nothing.</p>]
