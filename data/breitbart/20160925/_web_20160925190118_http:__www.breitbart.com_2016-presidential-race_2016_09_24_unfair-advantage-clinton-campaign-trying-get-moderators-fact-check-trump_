[<p>The first debate Monday puts NBC News\u2019 Lester Holt front and center as Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton square off for the first time. Team Clinton wants Holt to intercede in the debate\u2013and often.</p>, <p>\u201cThis is the role of the\xa0moderator\xa0\u2026\xa0to call out those lies, and do it in real time,\u201d Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri <a href="/web/20160925141253/http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-trailguide-updates-trump-lies-clinton-1474655180-htmlstory.html">told reporters on a conference call</a>.\xa0\u201cTo not do that is to give Donald Trump a very unfair advantage.\xa0Any candidate\xa0who tells this many lies clearly can\u2019t win the debate on the merits.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cHis level of lying is unprecedented in American politics,\u201d Palmieri said of Trump.</p>, <p>Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace, who is moderating the final debate in Las Vegas, already said that his role is not to be a fact-checker.</p>, <p>But Lester Holt could be problematic. Holt is already drawing scrutiny from conservatives fearing a \u201cCandy Crowley\u201d moment that could swing the debate. <a href="/web/20160925141253/http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/09/08/moderators-under-scrutiny-as-mainstream-media-attacks-matt-lauer/">Breitbart News reported</a>:</p>, <p>Lester Holt <a href="/web/20160925141253/http://www.uspresidentialelectionnews.com/2016-debate-schedule/2016-presidential-debate-schedule/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">is up first</a>.\xa0He gets Trump and Clinton at Hofstra University in New York on September 26.</p>, <p>It was originally supposed to be held at Wright State University in the battleground state of Ohio. But university President David Hopkins <a href="/web/20160925141253/http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/wright-state-university-set-to-make-major-debate-a/nr2Jw/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">had to withdraw due to \u201crising security costs\u201d</a> of up\xa0to $11 million that the college had to pay. Hopkins, chastened, thanked Hofstra for at least allowing 15 Wright State students to attend the debate in New York.</p>, <p>Hofstra has given Bill Clinton <a href="/web/20160925141253/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2015/05/22/the-list-of-colleges-that-paid-big-money-to-the-clintons-for-speeches/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">at least six figures for speaking fees</a>.\xa0When Clinton spoke at Hofstra, the university touted him <a href="/web/20160925141253/http://www.hofstra.edu/community/culctr/clinton/clinton_ur_conference.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">as a legendary \u201cNew Democrat\u2019 from Hope</a>.\u201d</p>, <p>At NBC News, Lester Holt replaced Brian Williams during a time of scandal. But he is working to establish himself as something other than a mere Gerald Ford caretaker of the anchor\u2019s chair.</p>, <p>Holt asked Hillary Clinton if she ever gets her \u201cfeelings hurt\u201d due to the Republican attacks on her. Referring to a young person in a town hall event who said that his generation feels Clinton is dishonest, <a href="/web/20160925141253/http://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/brent-baker/2016/01/29/nbcs-holt-winced-hrc-called-dishonest-worries-if-she-gets-her" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Holt said to</a>\xa0Clinton, \u201cAnd when he said that I winced.\u201d</p>, <p>NewsBusters flagged Holt for a number of comments during the campaign that should make the Trump team very nervous about the primetime exposure that he is getting. Particularly, comments that Holt made when he managed to interview The Donald to his face once at Trump Tower.</p>]
