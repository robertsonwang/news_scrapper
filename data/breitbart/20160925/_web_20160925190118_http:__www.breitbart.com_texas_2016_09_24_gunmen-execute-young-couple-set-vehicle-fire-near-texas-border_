[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Coahuila state investigators recently responded to the banks of the Rio Grande River near the Santa Maria neighborhood where they found a late model Jeep Commander fully engulfed in flames.

Soon after the murder, authorities were able to identify the victims as 28-year-old Valentin Guerrero and 24-year-old Montserrat Reyes Galaviz. </span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Authorities have not made a motive for the murder public. However, the border city of Piedras Negras has a long history of being a drug trafficking corridor for the Los Zetas drug cartel. Unlike other cartels, Los Zetas have sought to distinguish themselves through their ruthlessness and gory methods of executions. </span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Breitbart Texas reported this year the results of a three month investigation into how Los Zetas were able to <a href="/web/20160925231709/http://livepage.apple.com/"><span class="s2">kidnap, execute and incinerate approximately 300 victims</span></a> including women and children. The mass extermination appears to have been possible by various corrupt government officials who allowed cartel members to incinerate half of the victims inside a state prison.</span></p>, <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Editor\u2019s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Le\xf3n to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.\xa0 The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used.\xa0</i><a href="/web/20160925231709/http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2015/02/15/breitbart-texas-announces-cartel-chronicles-effort-begins-to-help-citizen-journalists-in-mexico/"><span class="s2"><i>Breitbart Texas\u2019 Cartel Chronicles</i></span></a><i>\xa0are published in both English and in their original\xa0</i><a href="/web/20160925231709/http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2015/02/15/cronicas-de-carteles-breitbart-texas-un-esfuerzo-por-ayudar-a-los-periodistas-de-ciudadanos-en-mexico/"><span class="s2"><i>Spanish</i></span></a><i>.
