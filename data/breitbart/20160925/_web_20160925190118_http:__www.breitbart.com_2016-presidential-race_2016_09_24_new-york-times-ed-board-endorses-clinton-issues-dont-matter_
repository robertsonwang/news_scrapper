[<p>\u201cIn any normal election year, we\u2019d compare the two presidential candidates side by side on the issues. But this is not a normal election year,\u201d the <em>Times</em> admitted in its first sentence. It continued:</p>, <p>A comparison like that would be an empty exercise in a race where one candidate \u2014 our choice, Hillary Clinton \u2014 has a record of service and a raft of pragmatic ideas, and the other, Donald Trump, discloses nothing concrete about himself or his plans while promising the moon and offering the stars on layaway. (We will explain in a subsequent editorial why we believe Mr. Trump to be the worst nominee put forward by a major party in modern American history.)</p>, <p>So Clinton is being propped up by the so-called newspaper of record, and that newspaper is openly conceding that the issues have nothing to do with it. Predictably, it is all about Trump. But the <em>Times</em>, in defiance of the standards of coherent literature, also shoots down the very premise that it established in its opening sentence, claiming, \u201cRunning down the other guy won\u2019t suffice to make that argument. The best case for Hillary Clinton cannot be, and is not, that she isn\u2019t Donald Trump.\xa0The best case is, instead, about the challenges this country faces, and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s capacity to rise to them.\u201d</p>, <p>Also, she\u2019s a woman. The <em>Times</em> opines:</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content">The 2016 campaign has brought to the surface the despair and rage of poor and middle-class Americans who say their government has done little to ease the burdens that recession, technological change, foreign competition and war have heaped on their families.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content">Over 40 years in public life, Hillary Clinton has studied these forces and weighed responses to these problems. Our endorsement is rooted in respect for her intellect, experience, toughness and courage over a career of almost continuous public service, often as the first or only woman in the arena.</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content">When the <em>Times</em> finally does address some issues, the endorsement reads like a carbon copy of Clinton campaign literature:</p>, <p class="story-body-text story-content">Mrs. Clinton\u2019s record of service to children, women and families has spanned her adult life. One of her boldest acts as first lady was her 1995 speech in Beijing declaring that women\u2019s rights are human rights. After a failed attempt to overhaul the nation\u2019s health care system, she threw her support behind legislation to establish the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, which now covers more than eight million lower-income young people. This year, she rallied mothers of gun-violence victims to join her in demanding comprehensive background checks for gun buyers and tighter reins on gun sales.</p>]
