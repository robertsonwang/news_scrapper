[<p>The report notes that after years of championing multi-national trade deals,\xa0Republican senators who are facing contentious reelections are now rhetorically \u201csprint[ing] away\u201d from their previous support of President Obama\u2019s Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement.</p>, <p>Opposing\xa0the Trans-Pacific Partnership has been a central platform of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.</p>, <p>Politico<em>\xa0</em>writes, \u201cThe GOP\u2019s unshakable faith in free trade has been decidedly broken in the year of Trump \u2014 with everyone from a former U.S. trade representative, Rob Portman of Ohio, to free-market devotee Marco Rubio of Florida striking a much different tone.\u201d</p>, <p>By \u201cfree trade,\u201d the report is referring to what trade experts, such as\xa0Nucor Steel Chairman Daniel DiMicco, have described as \u201cunilateral trade disarmament and enablement of foreign mercantilism.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201c[T]he\xa0Republican sprint away from the TPP is a remarkable policy reversal for a party that has traditionally championed itself as the party of free trade,\u201d\xa0Politico<em>\xa0</em>writes.</p>, <p>Indeed, just last year, Republican Senate leaders issued an <a href="/web/20160925143718/http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/08/27/gop-leaders-media-agenda-ignore-immigration-wages/">internal messaging memo</a> to all GOP senators, an exclusive copy of which was obtained and published by\xa0Breitbart News. The memo\xa0urged GOP senators to meet with business groups during the August recess to tout the GOP\u2019s vote\xa0to\xa0fast-track\xa0Obama\u2019s TPP.</p>, <p>Politico\xa0further<em>\xa0</em>notes\xa0that\xa0for several of the senators now rhetorically distancing themselves from the TPP, this represents a complete reversal from their prior statements.</p>, <p>The report states\xa0that in April of 2015,\xa0Marco Rubio\xa0\u201cwrote an<a href="/web/20160925143718/http://www.wsj.com/articles/asia-needs-a-strong-u-s-japan-alliance-1430329908" target="_blank">\xa0op-ed in <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>\xa0and urged passage of TPP.\u201d Rubio then delivered the sixtieth\xa0and deciding vote to fast-track the TPP. No deal placed on fast-track has ever been blocked, which is why, at the time, Sen. Jeff Sessions suggested that voting to give Obama fast-track authority was essentially a proxy vote for TPP. In an interview with\xa0Politico, Rubio appears to now be refusing to take a position on the multinational trade deal that\xa0he previously\xa0voted to fast-track. However, Rubio\xa0did tell\xa0Politico<em>\xa0</em>that he supports TPP as a concept.</p>, <p>\u201cTPP as a concept is something I support.\xa0I\u2019d love to have a free trade agreement with the Asia-Pacific region. But it has to be the right deal,\u201d Rubio said.</p>, <p>Politico\xa0notes that other senators, such as Sen. Ron Johnson from Wisconsin, have\xa0\u201csimply declined to answer questions about their TPP position.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cWisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson has yet to take a stance on TPP and declined in an interview to say whether he even has any concerns,\u201d Politico writes.</p>, <p>Politico\xa0notes that with Trump as the\xa0party\u2019s standard bearer,\xa0\u201cestablishment-minded Republicans\u201d up for reelection have been forced to walk\xa0a \u201ctightrope\u201d\xa0between trying to appeal to Republican voters\u2013who are skeptical of so-called \u201cfree trade\u201d\u2013and appease Republican donors and organizations like the Chamber of Commerce and Club for Growth that\xa0lobby for more global trade:</p>, <p>The upended politics of trade offer a major conundrum for establishment-minded Republicans running for reelection this year, particularly in Rust Belt states that could help determine control of the Senate next year. Perhaps more than any other issue, trade has illustrated the tightrope GOP candidates have to walk in trying to appeal to Trump-fueled voters while not abandoning the GOP\u2019s core economic principles.</p>, <p>Polling data shows Republican voters are among the most skeptical of so-called \u201cfree trade\u201d deals, more so than Democrats. According to Pew, only a vanishing 11 percent of Republican voters believe that so-called \u201cfree-trade\u201d will raise wages. By a nearly 5-to-1 margin, Republican voters believe that so-called \u201cfree trade\u201d depresses wages, rather than increases wages, and by a greater than 3-to-1 margin, Republican voters believe that \u201cfree trade\u201d will kill jobs, not create them.</p>]
