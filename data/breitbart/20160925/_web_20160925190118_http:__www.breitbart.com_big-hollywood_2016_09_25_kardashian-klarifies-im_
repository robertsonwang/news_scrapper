[<p>\u201cA \u2018quote\u2019 of mine was released yesterday causing my phone to blow up by friends, family and even both candidates\u2019 camps, so I want to explain the context in which I said I was \u2018on the fence\u2019 about my vote,\u201d the 35-year-old <em>Keeping up with the Kardashians</em> star wrote in a <a href="/web/20160926161847/https://www.kimkardashianwest.com/behind-the-scenes/1426-kim-kardashian-hillary-clinton/" target="_blank">brief statement</a>.</p>, <p>Kardashian said she had considered refraining from voting in this year\u2019s election, but after considering issues of most importance to her, including gun control and abortion rights, she decided to go with Clinton over Trump.</p>, <p>\u201cI found that without a doubt, I stand with Hillary. I\u2019m with her. I believe Hillary will best represent our country and is the most qualified for the job. This year, I\u2019m not just voting for myself, but also for my children, and I took that into careful consideration when I made my decision.\u201d</p>, <p>In an <a href="/web/20160926161847/http://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-is-a-handson-dad-just-don-t-ask-him-to-do-the-night-feed-a3351416.html" target="_blank">interview</a> for <em>Wonderland</em>\u2018s Autumn 2016 fashion issue published Friday, Kardashian said that\xa0she had become conflicted about who to vote for after having a long political discussion with her step-father Caitlyn Jenner, an <a href="/web/20160926161847/http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2016/02/18/bruce-jenner-trans-hollywood-easier-republican/" target="_blank">outspoken Republican</a>.</p>, <p>\u201cAt first I thought, \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019m so Hillary [Clinton]\u2019, but I had a long political call with Caitlyn last night about why she\u2019s voting Trump. I\u2019m on the fence,\u201d the reality TV star said.</p>, <p>.The quote caught many of her fans by surprise; Kardashian had been an apparent Clinton supporter, having told media outlets she would vote for her and having attended at least one fundraiser for the candidate.\xa0She <a href="/web/20160926161847/http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2015/08/07/hillary-goes-trolling-takes-selfie-with-kim-kardashian-kanye-at-hollywood-fundraiser/" target="_blank">snapped a selfie</a> with her husband Kanye West and with Clinton at a Los Angeles fundraiser last year, a photo the candidate later gushed about in an <a href="/web/20160926161847/http://www.people.com/article/hillary-clinton-selfie-kim-kardashian-ellen-degeneres-show" target="_blank">interview</a> on <em>Ellen</em>.</p>, <p>Kardashian concluded her statement by saying that she had nothing against people supporting Trump in this year\u2019s election.</p>, <p>\u201cNow that I have made my choice I want to be clear\u2026 I would never judge anyone based on their political or religious beliefs. I believe that both candidates have the intention of making the country a safer and stronger place for every American, they just have different ideas about how we get there.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cGod bless America for allowing us to even make these decisions \u2013 there are so many in this world who are not so privileged,\u201d she added.</p>, <p>\xa0</p>, <p><em>Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: <a href="/web/20160926161847/https://twitter.com/dznussbaum" target="_blank">@dznussbaum</a></em></p>]
