[<p>I know what you\u2019re thinking. If every priest looked like this those little boys would stop complaining.</p>, <p>Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to mourn the passing \u2014 no! No, it\u2019s not Hillary in there, stop it.</p>, <p>Or Harambe.</p>, <p>No, we are gathered here in the presence of God \u2026</p>, <p>(SLIDE: DONALD TRUMP)</p>, <p>Yes, that one.</p>, <p>Oh, speaking of daddy, I hear Glenn Beck is on suicide watch after Ted Cruz\u2019s endorsement, but hasn\u2019t jumped off the ledge yet so it isn\u2019t him in the coffin either.</p>, <p>No, we are gathered to mourn the passing of something much like Harambe. A great and much-loved American institution, gone before its time.</p>, <p>An institution that began life with the promise of hope, with the vitality and vibrancy of youth.</p>, <p>It\u2019s a life that has ended now, cut short by hubris, by Hitler memes, and by Hillary.</p>, <p>I am speaking of course about Twitter.</p>, <p>God has a habit of smiling down on the Dangerous Faggot. Just this morning we learned that Twitter is in talks with Google and Salesforce about a potential buyout, and may receive a formal bid soon.</p>, <p>Being sold to another company is the corporate version of deleting your account, and Twitter is now on the brink of a humiliating fire sale after months, perhaps years, of nosediving stock price.</p>, <p>This comes as the company loses yet more key staffers, including its head of TV, and the head of its awful \u201cMoments\u201d feature.</p>, <p>At its inception, Twitter was the bright young face of social media. Now, well, it\u2019s FUCKING DEAD.</p>, <p>How did this happen?</p>, <p>Well, it wasn\u2019t just because they banned their most fabulous user.</p>, <p>Some of the nails in this coffin are more apparent than others, like the company\u2019s legal problems. Even Twitter\u2019s own investors are filing lawsuits against it.</p>, <p>I\u2019ve had to keep revising this speech to change the number of law firms formally investigating Twitter,.</p>, <p>The lawsuits and investigations have a consistent theme \u2014 they allege that Twitter has misled its investors.</p>, <p>One way Twitter allegedly misled its investors was with incredibly rosy user projections. They claimed they\u2019d have 550 million users in the \u201cintermediate term\u201d and a billion at some time in the future.</p>, <p>With Twitter\u2019s tiny user growth rate, our descendants might well be memeing from Mars by the time the platform has a billion people on it.</p>, <p>There are still more serious charges here. Twitter is accused of misleading investors by not disclosing material changes to the company.</p>, <p>For those of you that don\u2019t deal with the stock market and public companies, in the interest of protecting investors, companies are required to disclose changes that might will be important for investment decisions.</p>, <p>Most companies go a bit overboard on what they disclose, to make sure they don\u2019t get the type of lawsuits Twitter is now on the receiving end of.</p>, <p>In Twitter\u2019s case, the lawsuits and other investigations, of which there are at least 12 happening now, allege that Twitter changed the internal metrics they use to gauge usage of the site from timeline views to daily active users.</p>, <p>That may not seem like a big deal to you, it\u2019s just a simple change in how users are viewed. But the investors in Twitter\u2019s stock should have known about it. And the reason they should have known is that those numbers show Twitter usage is flat or declining.</p>, <p>There are other grim allegations that further close Twitter\u2019s coffin. Charges like this \u2014 their new products and innovations have not had the slightest impact on monthly active users or engagement.</p>, <p>Or that the stated acceleration in users is due to quote \u201clow quality monthly active user growth\u201d unquote. Low quality users sounds suspiciously like the bots and garbage accounts that clog our feeds.</p>, <p>Or maybe they just mean Black Lives Matter.</p>, <p>Twitter\u2019s investors have taken very serious losses on this stock. It has dropped from about $50 a share 18 months ago to just $18 today.</p>, <p>Investors don\u2019t get mad, they get even. Well, that\u2019s a lie, they get very mad, then they call their lawyer to get even\u2026. And Twitter, God rest its soul, is feeling that now.</p>, <p>Twitter may have legal problems coming from others beyond their investors.</p>, <p>For one thing, there\u2019s the Milo problem. I know, I know, like the Holy Ghost, I always seem to pop up when you least expect me.</p>, <p>After being banned from Twitter permanently, I requested all of their records about me from their European headquarters, a legal right we have in Europe.</p>, <p>They wouldn\u2019t respond, they claimed I live in America! While it is flattering to pass as American, it simply isn\u2019t true. I am currently appealing to the data protection commissioner for Ireland, and if necessary will escalate it to the court system.</p>, <p>I suspect, and my devoted congregation will no doubt agree, Twitter must have some notes on my account that they really really REALLY don\u2019t want released.</p>, <p>But as hard as it is to believe, I may not be Twitter\u2019s worst headache, at least legally speaking.</p>, <p>The Left thinks the government has a moral obligation to force small Christian owned businesses to personally bake cakes for and to personally photograph gay weddings or provide free birth control, but a publicly traded company valued at more than $10 Billion can discriminate all it wants\u2014so long it\u2019s aimed at conservative white men.</p>, <p>When I asked Barack Obama\u2019s press secretary Josh Earnest about social media censorship at a White House press briefing in March, he sounded like Milton Friedman when he responded, \u201cpart of what\u2019s built into our system is a respect for private companies to put in place their own policies.\u201d</p>, <p>This was news to me. Never in the Obama administration\u2019s history has it showed any \u201crespect for private companies to put in place their own policies.\u201d The vast majority of the over 20,000 regulations issued since he took office restricted private companies\u2019 ability to enact their own policies.</p>, <p>Furthermore, I did not ask the government to do anything to Twitter, and nor have the vast majority of libertarian and conservative critics of Twitter\u2019s censorship. I simply wanted to ask the President to reaffirm the values of free speech \u2013 not just because free expression is a good in and of itself, but also because it\u2019s good business.</p>, <p>Some legal minds feel attacks on Twitter will come in the form of free speech arguments that are not first amendment based.</p>, <p>These might take several forms:</p>, <p>Any of these scenarios may come to pass against Twitter. If I were in Twitter\u2019s legal department, I\u2019d be more nervous than Anthony Weiner\u2019s Rabbi.</p>, <p>A lot of executives have jumped ship over the last year, but no one from legal. I wonder why?</p>, <p>Twitter\u2019s product is notoriously terrible. Everyone has experienced problems with their mobile apps, but the platform had tremendous potential.</p>, <p>From becoming an excellent way to spread information and articles, to making history on the fly by trending the truth outside of the mainstream media, Twitter had important roles to play in our culture.</p>, <p>So what went wrong? Twitter converted, like your crazy cousin that went to a Glenn Beck rally and came out a Mormon.</p>, <p>They didn\u2019t convert religions, but they converted from being a free speech platform to being a clubhouse for the regressive left.</p>, <p>They stopped caring about great content from the most entertaining and creative people and devoted their efforts to not offending people who are perpetually offended.</p>, <p>Consequently, all the \u201cproblematic,\u201d mischievous, artistic, dissident, subversive people, like me, Azealia Banks and a wide variety of lesser-known libertarian and conservative writers, thinkers and shitlords, have been nuked. More will follow.</p>, <p>Twitter\u2019s politics reflect the worst that can be found on American college campuses. The company has repeatedly prioritised hurt feelings over free speech.</p>, <p>As Twitter systematically bans the best and most creative users and turns their site into an unholy alliance of crybaby SJWs and militant Islamists, regular users have come to the conclusion that Twitter is not the place to be anymore.</p>, <p>Assuming they ever wanted to be there.</p>, <p>All social media companies were built, at least partly, on the promise of free speech. Over the past few years, we\u2019ve seen that this promise is a lie.</p>, <p>This is true for every social media giant. Facebook just announced a voter registration drive \u2014 obviously an attempt to tilt the election in favour of Hillary Clinton. They recently fired their entire trending news team after we exposed their progressive biases. And of course, as Pamela Geller will tell you, they are just as quick to clamp down on conservatives as Twitter.</p>, <p>But more than Facebook, I think the betrayal of free-speech values is particularly acute Twitter, which once \u2013 don\u2019t laugh \u2013 billed itself as the \u201cfree speech wing of the free speech party.\u201d</p>, <p>Their supposed purpose, is still, and I quote \u201cOur mission: To give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly, without barriers.\u201d</p>, <p>Twitter was once the home of political radicalism. It was one of the primary platforms for Occupy Wall Street and the primary platform for the Arab Spring. It would be difficult for any similar movement to emerge on the platform today, let alone a conservative one.</p>, <p>Can you imagine third-world revolutionaries using Twitter today? \u201cTopple the dictator! March on his palace! Pull down his statues!\u201d Oh wait, you\u2019ve been banned for abuse and harassment \u2026</p>, <p>The progressive left piles disingenuous demands for rules against \u201cabuse,\u201d \u201charassment\u201d and \u201chate speech\u201d onto the company. (As always with the left, these words are just another way of saying \u201cyou hurt my feelings.\u201d)</p>, <p>Twitter is also hopelessly beholden to a small selection of celebrities \u2014 overly dramatic, attention seeking divas who constantly make a scene over tiny things. I hate those kinds of people.</p>, <p>Really though, it\u2019s true. Twitter marches to the tune of a tiny group of pushy progressive celebs. Worse, they aren\u2019t even the hot ones!</p>, <p>(SLIDE: LESLIE JONES)</p>, <p>I mean, if you\u2019re going to sell out your core values to a celebrity, at least pick someone good looking! Showbiz is one of the few areas where the fashionable and handsome outnumber the grotesque.</p>, <p>It was BuzzFeed, in a rare act of passable journalism, that revealed the extent of corruption at Twitter. When Zelda Williams threatened to quit Twitter \u2013 okay, in fairness, unlike our friend Leslie she\u2019s at least about a seven.</p>, <p>When Zelda Williams threatened to quit Twitter over abuse, the company\u2019s entire executive board met to discuss the problem. According to an insider at the company, the CEO \u201cscrambled\u201d to delete accounts accused of harassing her.</p>, <p>Let\u2019s be clear, the harassment of Williams, which took place after the death of her father, Robin, was not pleasant. But that is what block buttons are for.</p>, <p>Getting mean messages online is part of being famous, trust me. Most people are sensible enough to just switch off the computer. But progressives and celebrities \u2014 but i repeat myself \u2014 use nasty comments, which everyone in public life gets, as political ammunition.</p>, <p>Twitter is not a platform for free speech any more. But it\u2019s not really anti-harassment either \u2014 I mean, come on, if they banned everyone who hurt someone\u2019s feelings, they\u2019d have to ban every gay, every feminist, every BLM activist and every journalist from the platform.</p>, <p>That would leave about 11 people.</p>, <p>Instead, Twitter has a protected class of privileged users who it defends from minor slights, and a slowly depleting mass that it neglects and brands as \u201cabusers\u201d and \u201ctrolls.\u201d</p>, <p>There are also, of course, users that Twitter explicitly refuses to protect and users who can, it seems to the rest of us, get away with literally anything.</p>, <p>Black Lives Matter activists flout Twitter\u2019s rules against incitement to violence on a daily basis by calling for the deaths of policemen on the platform, and Twitter does nothing.</p>, <p>The BLM hashtag is on the wall at Twitter. So this is perhaps no surprise. Of course, if you believe what people are saying, Twitter is quite literally in bed with Black Lives Matter.</p>, <p>(SLIDE: DORSEY AND DERAY)</p>, <p>Republicans, including Donald Trump, are bombarded with death threats, and Twitter does nothing.</p>, <p>Feminist activists are allowed to dox and harass whomever they please, with no repercussions. Twitter does nothing.</p>, <p>Conservative women, in particular, are subjected to daily ritual humiliation. Twitter does nothing.</p>, <p>And it\u2019s only now, after years of criticism, that Twitter is doing anything to combat terrorism on its platform. For years it was the case that you could openly recruit for ISIS on Twitter, but get suspended for ridiculing feminists.</p>, <p>The result of this uneven enforcement is a lack of trust from users. Where Twitter users once felt free to speak their minds, now they hesitate, wondering if their next tweet will get them banned. This is a recipe for disaster.</p>, <p>Think about it for a moment. Twitter is a platform for short, sharp, snappy comments. It\u2019s somewhere for you to say what\u2019s on your mind, as it pops into your head, without hesitation.</p>, <p>So what happens when you take a platform built for speaking your mind, and add fear of arbitrary punishment into the equation? Users will hesitate. They won\u2019t speak their mind. They\u2019ll start to think of how they can caveat their words with politically correct niceties, how they can couch their language, how they can please everyone \u2014 and suddenly, guess what? You\u2019re way over the character limit.</p>, <p>Twitter took an experience that was fun, like chatting to your mates at a bar, and turned it into a place of fear, where you\u2019re still chatting to your mates at a bar \u2014 but there\u2019s a squad of Stasi agents sipping cocktails a few seats away.</p>, <p>The result has been entirely predictable. Users are simply logging off.</p>, <p>Twitter may have dug their own grave, they may have their investors nailing the coffin shut, but it is the users who are carrying the shovels to fill in the hole.</p>, <p>User growth at Twitter is moribund. The growth in monthly active users per quarter is less than a single month at Facebook. And remember, the smart money has been saying Facebook isn\u2019t the place to be for quite a while now.</p>, <p>Compared to the rapid double digit growth of platforms like Snapchat, Twitter\u2019s lack of growth is an embarrassment.</p>, <p>You don\u2019t have to believe the user stats either. You can follow the money and get the whole story.</p>, <p>RBC Capital Markets has completed a new survey of advertisers, and has found damning evidence that advertisers recognize Twitter is not an effective way to reach consumers.</p>, <p>For the first time ever, more advertisers plan to decrease their Twitter ad spend than increase it.</p>, <p>30% of surveyed firms won\u2019t spend a dime on Twitter, and only 3% see a rising return on investment when advertising on Twitter.</p>, <p>Advertisers don\u2019t care about politics, they care about consumers seeing their ads and engaging with them, and it isn\u2019t happening on Twitter any more.</p>, <p>Of seven key advertising platforms in the survey, Twitter is ranked fifth. Google, Facebook and YouTube are the top three.</p>, <p>As I mentioned before, European consumers have a layer of protection that Americans don\u2019t have. We can legally request private companies to provide to us all information they hold about us.</p>, <p>Twitter has become so ideologically driven, opaque in its business practices and schizophrenic in its rule enforcement, I believe it is a very good idea for any European Twitter user to request their personal data.</p>, <p>It costs you less than 7 euros to make the request, and if it costs a lot more than that for Twitter to comply, that\u2019s their problem, right?</p>, <p><a href="/web/20160925143137/https://iwantmytwitterdata.com/">That\u2019s why today I\u2019m announcing the launch of a website</a> that will help you to do just that. I hope to encourage 10,000 people from the UK, Ireland, Germany, France and other EU countries to request their data from Twitter and see what the company is saying about you.</p>, <p>The age of social media censorship began recently. In early 2013, it was still just a distant dot on the horizon. But some people saw it coming. One of those was the late progressive activist Aaron Swartz, a rare example of a liberal who still cared about free speech. Here is what he said.</p>, <p>Both the government and private companies can censor. But private companies are a little bit scarier. They have no constitution to answer to. They\u2019re not elected. They have no constituents or voters. All of the protections we\u2019ve built up to protect against government tyranny don\u2019t exist for corporate tyranny.</p>, <p>Is the internet going to stay free? Are private companies going to censor the websites I visit, or charge more to visit certain websites? Is the government going to force us to not visit certain websites? And when I visit these websites, are they going to constrain what I can say, to only let me say certain types of things, or steer me to certain types of pages? All of those are battles that we\u2019ve won so far, and we\u2019ve been very lucky to win them. But we could quite easily lose, so we need to stay vigilant.</p>, <p>Had Swartz lived, he would have seen his warning come true. He would seen social media companies abandon their ideals of free speech and become vehicles of censorship and political discrimination.</p>, <p>He would have seen the platform of the Arab Spring become the platform of whiny, privileged Ghostbusters stars.<br/>\nAnd what\u2019s more, he would have seen it all draped in the PR-friendly shroud of progressive causes like feminism.<br/>\nWould Swartz have been a progressive today?</p>, <p>Ladies and gentlemen of the congregation I invite you now to join me in a celebration of the life of Twitter, Inc.</p>, <p>Please stand.</p>, <p>(SLIDE: RIP TWITTER)</p>, <p>A fitting end, I hope you will agree, to a life marked by treachery, deceit and ignominy.</p>, <p>God bless you all, and I am happy to take your questions.</p>, <p>Watch Milo\u2019s full speech below.</p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="557" src="/web/20160925143137if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/JoLs61YwuSM?feature=oembed" width="990"></iframe></p>]
