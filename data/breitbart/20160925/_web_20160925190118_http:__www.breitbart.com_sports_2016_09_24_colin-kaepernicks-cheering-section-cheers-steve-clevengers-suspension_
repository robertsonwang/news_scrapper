[<p>Welcome to America, 2016.</p>, <p>\u201dBlack people beating whites when a thug got shot holding a gun by a black police officer hahaha,\u201d Clevenger tweeted. \u201cShit cracks me up! Keep kneeling for the anthem!\u201d He labeled Black Lives Matter and the president \u201cpathetic,\u201d expressing his opinion that the people involved in the Charlotte riots deserve to be locked up \u201clike animals.\u201d</p>, <p>Harsh stuff. But athletes, as Colin Kaepernick\u2019s defenders incessantly insist, retain a right to their opinion. Okay, okay, so they didn\u2019t really mean it. They meant: <em>Athletes retain a right to their opinion if it\u2019s also my opinion. </em></p>, <p>\u201cI\u2019m really stunned that he was suspended for the season,\u201d Jemele Hill <a href="/web/20160924083233/http://www.espn.com/video/clip?id=17619336">announced</a> on ESPN\u2019s <em>His &amp; Hers</em> on Friday. \u201cThe Seattle Mariners, they came out immediately, denounced his comments, said, \u2018This is not what the organization stands for.\u2019 But I guess I was sort of pleasantly surprised. Am I wrong for feeling that way?\u201d</p>, <p>A guest host, Jorge Sedano, seconded that emotion. \u201cI\u2019m pleasantly surprised because we need to out fools like this,\u201d Sedano said of the suspension. \u201cThat\u2019s just the reality of what we\u2019re doing today.\u201d</p>, <p>Colin Kaepernick\u2019s cheering section cheering the catcher\u2019s suspension for speech illustrates the mental gymnastics journalists play to toe the company line, which, as Curt Schilling and Mike Ditka could tell you, runs in a leftward direction in Bristol, Connecticut. ESPN, again, outs itself as the worldwide leader in hypocrisy.</p>, <p>Herbert Marcuse outlined this depends-whose-ox-is-being-gored mindset in \u201c<a href="/web/20160924083233/http://www.marcuse.org/herbert/pubs/60spubs/65repressivetolerance.htm">Repressive Tolerance</a>,\u201d a phrase he used to describe and denounce what most people regard as simple live-and-let-live tolerance. In this 51-year-old essay, the communist college professor championed a concept he called \u201cliberating tolerance,\u201d which meant \u201cintolerance against movements from the Right, and toleration of movements from the Left.\u201d</p>, <p>The concept caught-on on college campuses. Now sports journalists, who hail from many of those same bastions of \u201cliberating tolerance,\u201d push, as Nat Hentoff put it on a book cover, \u201cfree speech for me, but not for thee\u201d as well. In other words, people who make their living off their opinion want to deny another man his living because of his opinion.</p>, <p>Sure, the catcher expressed himself, as catchers sometimes do, harshly. But it\u2019s not as though a negligible number of people think little of the president, want Charlotte\u2019s looters and thugs jailed, regard those kneeling for the national anthem as disgraceful, and express confusion about why a black policeman shooting a black ex-con inspires a mob to go on a violent rampage against whites. Should they all lose their jobs too?</p>, <p>Tens of millions of Americans believe what Steve Clevenger believes. They just don\u2019t own the Seattle Mariners\u2014or ESPN.</p>, <p>Don\u2019t look anytime soon for the latter\u2019s <em>30 for 30</em> documentary chronicling the day the Seattle Mariners put a muzzle on a guy accustomed to wearing a catcher\u2019s mask. The story hits the network as an inconvenient truth. But <em>Time</em> coverboy Kaepernick\u2019s characterization as speaking truth to power continues as he enjoys the full support, and a paycheck rivaling Tom Brady, from his team and all the fawning from the Fourth Estate.</p>, <p>Not everyone enjoys free speech. For Steve Clevenger, his speech cost <a href="/web/20160924083233/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2016/09/23/mariners-suspend-steve-clevenger-without-pay-for-rest-of-the-season-over-nasty-tweets/">$33,868</a>. That\u2019s a big sacrifice to a guy making the league minimum. To Colin Kaepernick, that\u2019s what he gets paid for every 90 seconds he holds a clipboard.</p>, <p>Will the real John Peter Zenger please stand up?</p>, <p>\xa0</p>]
