I can\u2019t tell you.\u2019\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cThe way he speaks, his videos, when I see these things that he listens to, for example, Al Qaeda, Taliban, he watches their videos, their poetry,\u201d<a href="/web/20160925134151/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/09/23/jersey-jihadi-rahami-fascinated-jihad/"> Mr. Rahami</a> also said he told the federal agents.</p>, <p>Mr. Rahami reportedly described \u201chis son\u2019s admiration of<a href="/web/20160925134151/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/18/opinion/sunday/an-al-qaeda-martyrs-enduring-pitch.html"> Anwar al-Awlaki, who was once Al Qaeda\u2019s leading propagandist</a> and is popular with followers of the Islamic State [ISIS/ISIL], and also recalled that his son watched Mr. Awlaki\u2019s videos.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cThey [FBI agents] didn\u2019t do their job,\u201d the father told the<em> Times</em> during an interview conducted in his native language, Pashto.</p>, <p>Although Ahmad is believed to have been inspired by al-Qaeda and ISIS, neither group has claimed to be affiliated with the suspected bomber, who has been <a href="/web/20160925134151/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/21/nyregion/ahmad-khan-rahami-suspect.html">charged with using weapons of mass destruction and bombing a place of public use</a> in connection with the incidents last weekend that left 29 people wounded and fortunately no one dead.</p>, <p>The Taliban has denied any links to Ahmad.</p>, <p>In a series of interviews with <em>NYT</em>this week, Mohammad Rahami shared his interactions with the FBI prior to the bombings.</p>, <p>The<em> Times</em> reveals:</p>, <p>His [the father] description of that contact [with the FBI] differs starkly from the one given by law enforcement officials, who on Thursday challenged the father\u2019s account, saying he did not provide the F.B.I. with many of the details about his son that he now says he did.</p>, <p>Mr. Rahami\u2019s contact with the authorities began in August 2014, when the local police in Elizabeth, N.J., responded to the family\u2019s home after a domestic dispute in which Ahmad stabbed his brother, according to court records.</p>, <p>Law enforcement officials familiar with the case who would discuss it only on the condition of anonymity said that Mr. Rahami called his son a \u201cterrorist\u201d when talking to local police, which led to the F.B.I.\u2019s involvement.</p>, <p>When told that the FBI contradicted his account, Mr. Rahami told the<em> Times</em>, \u201cIt\u2019s a lie,\u201d adding that he stood by his version of events.</p>, <p>Ahmad was actually <a href="/web/20160925134151/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/09/20/nyt-rahamis-father-fought-soviet-army-afghan-opposed-afghanistan-war/">arrested in 2014</a> on weapons and aggravated assault charges and spent over three months in jail in connection with the stabbing of his brother, an incident that occurred a few months after Ahmad had spent nearly a year in the Afghan Taliban stronghold of Quetta, the capital of Pakistan\u2019s Balochistan province, which lies across the border of the southern Afghan province of Kandahar.</p>, <p>It was after the stabbing incident in 2014 that Mr. Rahami said he shared his concerns about his son with FBI agents.</p>, <p>Nevertheless, the FBI never interviewed him, reports <em>NYT</em>, citing two law enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity.</p>, <p>\u201cTwo years ago I go to the FBI because my son was doing really bad, O.K.?\u201d he said. \u201cBut they check almost two months, they say, \u2018He\u2019s O.K., he\u2019s clean, he\u2019s not a terrorist.\u2019 I say O.K.\u201d</p>, <p>He then added, \u201cNow they say he is a terrorist.

His sister Aziza Rahami shared her brother\u2019s fascination with al-Qaeda and, in fact, \u201cposted a stream of anti-American and jihadist rhetoric online, as questions were mounting about how the FBI came to dismiss repeated concerns about Ahmad Rahami,\u201d reports<a href="/web/20160925134151/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/21/ahmad-rahamis-sister-posted-radical-material-online-as-police-qu/"> <i>The Telegraph.</i></a></p>, <p>The father fought the <a href="/web/20160925134151/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/09/20/nyt-rahamis-father-fought-soviet-army-afghan-opposed-afghanistan-war/">Soviet Army</a> in the 80s as a member of the<a href="/web/20160925134151/http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/09/20/nyt-rahamis-father-fought-soviet-army-afghan-opposed-afghanistan-war/"> Afghan mujahedeen</a> (jihadists) that gave rise to the Taliban, got Osama bin Laden started on founding al-Qaeda, and spawned other jihadists and terrorist groups.</p>]
