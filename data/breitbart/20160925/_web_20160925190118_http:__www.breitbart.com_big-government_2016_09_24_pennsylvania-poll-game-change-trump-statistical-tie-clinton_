[<p>In a four-way race that includes Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein, the Pennsylvania race is even close, with Clinton leading Trump by just 2 points.

Republican presidential candidates have often hoped to carry Pennsylvania, as well as Michigan, in recent elections. However, <a href="/web/20160926155418/http://www.270towin.com/historical-presidential-elections/">neither state</a> has voted for a Republican nominee since 1988, when George H.W.
