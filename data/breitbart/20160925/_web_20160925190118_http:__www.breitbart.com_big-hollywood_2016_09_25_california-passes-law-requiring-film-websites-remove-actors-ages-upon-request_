[<p>Brown signed <a href="/web/20160926163248/http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB1687" target="_blank">AB 1687</a>, authored by Assemblyman Ian Calderon (D-Los Angeles), into law on Saturday, the governor\u2019s office announced on its <a href="/web/20160926163248/https://www.gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=19560" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>, <p>The law applies to entertainment casting websites that require a subscription to access, including the professional version of the Internet Movie Database (IMDb), a popular tool for casting agents.</p>, <p>Supporters of the law included SAG-AFTRA president and former actress Gabrielle Carteris, who wrote in an <a href="/web/20160926163248/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sag-aftras-gabrielle-carteris-actors-922253" target="_blank">essay</a> for the <em>Hollywood Reporter</em> last month that she hoped the law would combat the \u201cblatant age discrimination\u201d that casting agents employ when they are forced to consider\xa0an actor\u2019s age when casting for projects.</p>, <p>\u201cGov. Jerry Brown today stood with thousands of film and television professionals and concerned Californians who urged him to sign AB 1687, a California law that will help prevent age discrimination in film and television casting and hiring,\u201d Carteris said in a statement after the law\u2019s passage.</p>, <p>The bill had <a href="/web/20160926163248/http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2016/08/24/bill-allow-actors-keep-ages-private-online/" target="_blank">cleared the state Assembly</a> last month with broad support from Democrats, but some California Republicans said the law would do little to alleviate actual age discrimination in the industry.</p>, <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s so sacred about celebrity birth dates,\u201d Republican state Senator Jim Nielsen <a href="/web/20160926163248/http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-updates-state-senate-acts-on-hollywood-age-1471300215-htmlstory.html" target="_blank">told the <em>Los Angeles Times</em></a>\xa0in August. \u201c[Lawmakers] birth dates are everywhere. These celebrities are public figures just like most of us.\u201d</p>, <p>It is\xa0unclear how the law could be enforced against sites like IMDb,\xa0of which the free version of the site would be exempt from the requirement. As Deadline <a href="/web/20160926163248/http://deadline.com/2016/09/jerry-brown-signs-law-requiring-age-info-removal-from-imdb-on-request-1201825810/" target="_blank">notes</a>, the company could simply cancel the IMDb Pro subscription of those who request their ages be scrubbed from the site, thereby nullifying the requirement to do so.</p>, <p>The law could also face a First Amendment challenge from free speech advocates, many of whom, including Internet Association president and CEO Michael Beckerman, were strongly opposed to the measure.</p>, <p>\u201cRequiring the removal of factually accurate age information across websites suppresses free speech,\u201d Beckerman\xa0<a href="/web/20160926163248/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/law-keep-actor-ages-imdb-924441" target="_blank">wrote</a> in an op-ed for the <em>Hollywood Reporter</em> last month. \u201cThis is not a question of preventing salacious rumors; rather it is about the right to present basic facts that live in the public domain. Displaying such information isn\u2019t a form of discrimination, and internet companies should not be punished for how people use public data.\u201d</p>, <p>\xa0</p>, <p><em>Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: <a href="/web/20160926163248/https://twitter.com/dznussbaum" target="_blank">@dznussbaum</a></em></p>]
