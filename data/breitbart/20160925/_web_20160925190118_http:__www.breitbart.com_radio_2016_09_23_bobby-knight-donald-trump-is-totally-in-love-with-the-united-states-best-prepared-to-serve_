[<p>\u201cWell, I got there a little before he did and had a chance to talk with the people there, and it was really, really interesting.\u201d Knight recalled. \u201cI could sense a great anticipation. This place was jam-packed. I would imagine there were three, four thousand people there. I just scanned the audience, and I could see that on the face of everybody, anticipation of what St. Donald had to talk about.\u201d</p>, <p><strong>LISTEN:</strong></p>, <p><iframe frameborder="no" height="166" scrolling="no" src="/web/20160926002303if_/https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/284280055&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false" width="100%"></iframe></p>, <p>\u201cI think that it went extremely well in his favor. And the reason I think so is that I think people look at Trump as just another really concerned American citizen \u2014 like you are, and I am, and thousands of people are,\u201d he told Boyle. \u201cHe had a great rapport with those people last night.\u201d</p>, <p>Boyle asked Knight to turn his coach\u2019s eye upon Trump and talk about the qualities that make him a \u201cwinner,\u201d as he \u201cfights these epic political battles.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cYou brought up something that not many people would, and it really impresses me,\u201d Knight said, phrasing his reply in basketball coach terms:</p>, <p>We have an opponent, when I was coaching, whoever that opponent might be, it\u2019s my responsibility to give the players the tools to beat that opponent. They have a good pressing defense. I\u2019ve got to figure out a way to beat that press. Or they have a tough zone defense, or they have a post man who\u2019s very difficult to play against. It\u2019s my responsibility to see that my players have the tools to win that game \u2014 not they figure it out \u2014 I figure it out, and then they do the job.</p>, <p>Now, that\u2019s what brings me to Donald Trump. I was a history and government major at Ohio State University, and I\u2019ve spent a lot of time just fiddling around with who the next President\u2019s going to\xa0be, over the years, or who would I like to see in that job, or whatever. And I\u2019ve come to believe, without any reservation, in this era the best-prepared person for this job by far is Donald Trump.</p>, <p>The reason is because he has learned how to deal with problems. You know, he\u2019s not just an American. He\u2019s international. Everyone knows him. He has business all over the world. He\u2019s provided jobs everywhere. And all of the things he\u2019s done, like all of us, we run into problems. But I\u2019ve studied his background, and I\u2019ve looked at what he\u2019s been into. And something went wrong here, but he took care of it, and he straightened it out, and he did something else over there.</p>, <p>I think the key thing to this next president is: number one, a guy who has a tremendous love of the good old USA. And secondly, that president brings with him or her the background and the tools to do the job that it\u2019s going to take to get these problems straightened out. Nobody that I\u2019ve talked to has even attempted to challenge the fact that no one matches Donald Trump in that regard.</p>, <p>Boyle described the \u201cTrumpocrats\u201d \u2014 Democrats who are abandoning Hillary Clinton to vote for Donald Trump because they don\u2019t trust her \u2014 and asked Knight if he saw signs of such a movement in Indiana.</p>, <p>\u201cWell, I hope so because I think that\u2019s important to the future of our country,\u201d said Knight. \u201cI think the way he\u2019s going to approach things, his relationship with the military will be absolutely beyond that of anything we\u2019ve seen in a long way. There will be no president ever having a greater feeling for the military and all aspects of our military.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cAnd you can bet the farm on two things: that there will never be a Benghazi situation under a Donald Trump administration, nor will there ever be money that is given to somebody in the Trump administration by foreign countries that they use for their own benefit. That kind of thing just won\u2019t ever happen,\u201d he declared.</p>, <p>\u201cBut even more important, I think, is the relationship he will have with our military,\u201d Knight stressed. \u201cWhat is more important to us than the Marines, the Navy, the Air Force, the Coast Guard, our whole military establishment, and what those men, and those women, do for the United States is something beyond all of us as citizens, really can\u2019t come to thank them enough for what they do. And there\u2019ll be nobody in our governmental history that will be more inclined to deal and work with our military establishment than Donald Trump.\u201d</p>, <p>Boyle asked if Hillary Clinton\u2019s frequent disappearances from the campaign trail marked her as a \u201clow-energy candidate,\u201d and asked Knight what sort of energy level voters should seek in a president.</p>, <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to\xa0throw something at you, and then you tell me what you think of what I\u2019ve said, OK?\u201d Knight proposed:</p>, <p>Here\u2019s what I\u2019m going to\xa0throw at you: Donald Trump has been out every day \u2014 morning, noon and night \u2014 to let people see who he is. He isn\u2019t hiding anywhere. He isn\u2019t sitting back home anyplace. He\u2019s out there letting people ask him questions. And when he gets done, he stands there, and a little old grandma comes up and asks her a question, he gives her an answer.</p>, <p>And he\u2019s out there 24 hours a day, almost, letting people see who he is and giving people a chance to give this guy a look. How do we like this guy? We got to\xa0get him to quiet a little bit more, he walks flat, whatever the heck he does. You know, he has allowed America to see just exactly who he is and what he is, and he\u2019s not coming out of the closet. He\u2019s out there showing and talking about just what and who he is.</p>, <p>I think that\u2019s a tremendous thing that he\u2019s doing. He is saying, \u2018Folks, here\u2019s what I think, and here I am. I want you to just see what you think.\u2019</p>, <p>Knight said it was astute for Boyle to observe that Hillary Clinton is spending much of the campaign \u201chiding from us.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cIt seems to me that we\u2019ve got one candidate here that\u2019s giving everybody a chance to take a look at him, and we\u2019ve got another one where no one\u2019s sure where the hell that candidate is,\u201d Knight said. \u201cI think that says a lot.\u201d</p>, <p>He said being around Trump was always \u201cinteresting.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cI\u2019m a teacher. My mother was a teacher. I spent 40 years as a teacher. I think I have a pretty good grasp of people, and here is a guy who is thoroughly, totally in love with the United States of America, I think as much as anybody I\u2019ve ever known,\u201d he said of Donald Trump.</p>, <p>\u201cHis goal in life is to do something for America. And again, I say to anybody, you show me who can bring better tools to the job than Donald Trump can, and I\u2019ll vote for that guy along with you,\u201d Knight challenged.</p>, <p>Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m.\xa0to 9:00 a.m.\xa0Eastern.</p>, <p>Listen to the <a href="/web/20160926002303/https://soundcloud.com/breitbart/breitbart-news-daily-bob-knight-september-23-2016">full audio of the interview</a> above.</p>]
