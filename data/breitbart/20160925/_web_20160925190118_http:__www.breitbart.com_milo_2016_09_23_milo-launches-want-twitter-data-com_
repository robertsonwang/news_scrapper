Users are not informed whether they are being monitored, shadowbanned, or otherwise censored by Twitter. When they are openly punished by the company, all they receive is an automated email with no right of appeal. However, if you live in Europe, there\u2019s a way to learn more.\u201d </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The site then provides users with\xa0a step-by-step guide through the process of creating a Subject Access Request.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the Subject Access Request is filled out, users much attach a small money order to the letter and mail it to Twitter\u2019s European offices in Dublin, Ireland.
