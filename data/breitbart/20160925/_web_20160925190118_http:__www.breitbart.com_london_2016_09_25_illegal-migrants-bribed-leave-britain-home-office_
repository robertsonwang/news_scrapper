[<p>Appearing on a spiritual guru\u2019s television show called Spiritual Live, Richard Lederle, leader of the South-East England immigration compliance and enforcement team, advertised the Home Office\u2019s new programme, the <em>Mail on Sunday</em> <a href="/web/20160926163106/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3805943/Bribed-home-Illegal-migrants-given-hugely-generous-packages-persuade-leave-UK.html">reported</a>.</p>, <p class="mol-para-with-font">The Voluntary Returns Service is aimed at failed asylum seekers, foreign nationals who have overstayed their visas, and migrants who have illegally entered the country. The \u201ctailored packages\u201d being offered\xa0include paying for flights, assistance finding schools for their children, work placements, and even money to start up businesses in the migrants\u2019 home countries.</p>, <p class="mol-para-with-font">The scheme also includes amnesty from arrest\xa0if they attend meetings to discuss their return. Mr. Lederle told host guru Shri Raj Rajeshwar Guruji: \u201cYou can talk face-to-face without fear of being arrested. Let\u2019s be absolutely clear on that point, if they are willing to turn up to those surgeries, they will not be arrested.\u201d</p>, <p class="mol-para-with-font">Furthermore, the team operating under UK Visas and Immigration, a division of the Home Office, are promising that anyone who leaves\xa0voluntarily could be allowed back into the UK in as little as two years (whereas those who are forcibly deported are banned from returning for a decade).</p>, <p class="mol-para-with-font">Critics of the programme have said that the pay-offs\xa0are effectively signalling to illegal migrants\xa0that it is okay to be in Britain illegally. Conservative backbencher Andrew Bridgen said of the scheme: \u201cThis looks like a bribe for people who have already committed a criminal act by being here illegally. And it could act as an incentive for more people to come illegally.\u201d</p>, <p class="mol-para-with-font">The Home Office has been paying illegal migrants to leave Britain since 1999, with each illegal getting up to \xa32,000. However, the latest figures show the numbers taking up paid repatriation have fallen, from a high of 6,200 in 2006 to just 1,635 last year.</p>, <p class="mol-para-with-font">In one year, \xa38.8 million was spent on encouraging illegals to return to their country of origin, which included \xa32.1 million on flights, \xa337,000 on travel documents, and the rest going on funding the migrants\u2019 new lives back home.</p>, <p class="mol-para-with-font">With an estimated one million illegal migrants living in London alone, an asylum judge has <a href="/web/20160926163106/http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/08/22/asylum-judge-speaks-immigration-controls-broken-country-cannot-cope/">stated</a> that the government does not have the resources to find and deport them all.</p>, <p class="mol-para-with-font">A Home Office spokesman said the new system aims to save \xa35 million a year, adding: \u201cEnforced returns cost the taxpayer several thousand pounds. Helping those depart voluntarily costs much less.\u201d</p>, <p class="mol-para-with-font">In 2013 the Home Office attempted to encourage illegals to return home by driving a van around London bearing the message: \u201cIn the UK illegally? Go home or face arrest.\u201d A review later found that only 11 people had left as a direct result.</p>]
