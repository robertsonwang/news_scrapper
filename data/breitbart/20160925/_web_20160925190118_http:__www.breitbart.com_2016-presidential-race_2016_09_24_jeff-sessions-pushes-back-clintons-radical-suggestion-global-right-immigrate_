[<p>As Byron York first <a href="/web/20160925143527/http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2602573/?platform=hootsuite#!">reported</a>, earlier this week, Clinton\u2019s campaign indicated that she believes the world has a global right to immigrate to the United States\u2014a position that\xa0essentially dissolves the United States\u2019 status as a sovereign nation.</p>, <p>York explained that on Monday, Donald Trump delivered a speech in which he declared, \u201cWe want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally, through a process. \u2026 No one has a right to immigrate to this country.\u201d<em>\xa0</em></p>, <p>As John Hinderaker noted, such a statement should be understood as a truism. However, via Twitter, Clinton\u2019s campaign responded directly to Trump\u2019s statement and indicated that she \u201cdisagreed\u201d with it:</p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">"No one has the right to immigrate to this country." \u2014Donald Trump during his rally in Florida today</p>, <p>We disagree. <a href="/web/20160925143527/https://t.co/9gS9q5vQS9">https://t.co/9gS9q5vQS9</a></p>, <p>\u2014 Hillary for Ohio (@HillaryforOH) <a href="/web/20160925143527/https://twitter.com/HillaryforOH/status/778008382548553728">September 19, 2016</a></p>, <p><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="/web/20160925143527js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></p>, <p>Sessions explained that with this tweet, \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s campaign revealed the true extent of her radical views on immigration\u2014which apparently are that anyone has the right to demand entry into the United States.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cIn a telling admission, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign indicated it disagrees with the fundamental premise the world does not have a right to immigrate to the United States,\u201d Sessions wrote in a\xa0Friday statement.</p>, <p>\u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s policies are as radical as they are unprecedented,\u201d Sessions explained. \u201cWe must restore legality to our immigration system to ensure it serves the interests of all Americans, including lawful immigrants. This election may be our last chance to do so.\u201d</p>, <p>Sessions warned that Clinton\u2019s \u201cradical position, if enacted into policy, would result in an unmitigated fiscal disaster for the American people.\u201d</p>, <p>According to Dr. George Borjas\u2019 analysis of recent findings in a report by the National Academy of Sciences, \u201cThe national economic gains that accrue from immigration come directly at the expense of wages from those most adversely impacted by immigration\u2014to the tune of roughly $500 billion every year,\u201d Sessions wrote, adding:</p>, <p>Among those hardest hit are minorities and recent immigrants. The large immigrant flows tend to arrive in existing immigrant communities, thus, those communities suffer the greatest wage declines. This means that the dreams for economic prosperity of even recent immigrants are dashed, all because of an insatiable demand for ever more lower-skilled, lower-wage labor.</p>, <p>\u201cFor far too long, our immigration system has served the interests of the open-borders advocates\u2014corporate interests who benefit from lower wages that result from greater labor flows,\u201d Sessions wrote.</p>, <p>John Hinderaker echoed Sessions\u2019 sentiment and <a href="/web/20160925143527/http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/09/hillary-the-third-world-has-a-right-to-move-to-the-united-states.php">said</a> that \u201cin a sensible world, Hillary\u2019s apparent belief that foreigners have a \u2018right\u2019 to emigrate to the United States would disqualify her from the presidency.\u201d</p>, <p>Hinderaker noted:</p>, <p>\xa0In the first place, [Clinton] is simply wrong as a legal matter. \u2026 The ability to control who enters a country is a fundamental attribute of sovereignty. It is appalling that Mrs. Clinton fails to understand this basic fact. As a practical matter, a pure open borders policy, as implied by the claim that foreigners have a \u201cright to immigrate to this country,\u201d would be a disaster. Of the world\u2019s 7.4 billion people, at least three billion would be infinitely better off if they were living in the U.S. How many of those three billion\u2013a conservative estimate\u2013is Hillary prepared to accommodate?</p>, <p>Hinderaker added, \u201cHillary Clinton, with her vast wealth and phalanx of armed guards, may be insulated from the consequences of unprecedented immigration, both legal and illegal. But the rest of us are not.\u201d</p>]
