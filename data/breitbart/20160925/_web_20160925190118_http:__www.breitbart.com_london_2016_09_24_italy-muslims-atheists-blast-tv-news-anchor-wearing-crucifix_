[<p>Marina Nalesso, a well-known news <a href="/web/20160925143922/http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/cronache/conduce-tg1-col-crocifisso-linciata-dai-telespettatori-1309957.html">anchor</a> on the State-owned Tg1 television news show, wore a crucifix around her neck several times last week while on the air, a choice that Silvio Viale, a leftist politician and vocal atheist, has described as \u201carrogance.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cTG is a public, <a href="/web/20160925143922/http://newsitaliane.it/2016/marina-nalesso-giornalista-rai-indossa-crocifisso-medaglietta-della-madonna-tg1-polemica-78971">secular</a> news show, not a Vatican news show,\u201d he said.</p>, <p>On her FanPage, Nalesso defended her actions saying that she wears the crucifix \u201cout of devotion and to offer witness,\u201d though she can say nothing further because \u201cwe RAI journalists are not permitted to grant interviews without the authorization of management.\u201d</p>, <p>This is not the 44-year-old TV anchor\u2019s first offense. She has also been criticized for wearing small medals around her neck bearing the face of Jesus or the Virgin Mary.</p>, <p>Despite the storm of criticisms, however, Nalesso has also received support from several public figures such as Giorgia Meloni, an Italian politician and leader of the <em>Fratelli d\u2019Italia</em> party.</p>, <p>\u201cWe have now reached the point of absurdity,\u201d Meloni wrote on the party\u2019s Facebook <a href="/web/20160925143922/https://www.facebook.com/giorgiameloni.paginaufficiale/photos/a.343277597644.155355.38919827644/10154497404502645/?type=3&amp;theater">page</a>. \u201cChristianity is part of our culture and our history as Italians and Europeans, even if you are an atheist or believe in another religion.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cWhoever is bothered by a crucifix is bothered by our identity and they should go live somewhere else,\u201d she continued. \u201cA large part of the values of our civilization are bound up with that crucifix: a symbol that represents a richness for all of us, which we are proud to defend. Bravo Marina,\u201d she wrote.</p>, <p>Others <a href="/web/20160925143922/https://twitter.com/rickycerro/status/779414940503375873?lang=en">noted</a> that if the newscaster were wearing a Muslim veil instead of a Christian symbol, liberals would \u201crush to her defense in the name of sacred freedom of expression.\u201d</p>, <p>Several countries of northern Europe, such as Norway, have banned the wearing of religious symbols on television, but at the moment Italy has no such laws.</p>, <p><em>Follow Thomas D.
