[<p>The study, conducted by polling firm INSA Consulere for the <a href="/web/20160925143905/http://www.idea-pressedienst.de/artikel.html?tx_news_pi1%5Bid%5D=66920&amp;tx_news_pi1%5BbackPid%5D=6">Evangelical News Agency</a>, found 57 per cent of Germans hold a negative few of Islam in their country, including 61 per cent of women. Less than a third of respondents did not share this fear.</p>, <p>The fear of Islam is also particularly strong among Catholics at 61.5 percent, mainline Protestants at 59.6 per cent and other Christians at 55.5 per cent. Non-churchgoers are also wary of rising Islam, with 57 per cent saying they fear it.</p>, <p>The survey comes as German Chancellor Angel Merkel faces increasing criticism over her decision to open Germany\u2019s borders to over a million migrants last year, leading to a backlash among the German people and the rise of the anti-mass immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.</p>, <p>The poll also found that fear of rising crime as a result of the migrant influx is also high, particularly among the country\u2019s Jewish population, with 92 per cent of Jews saying they fear attacks.</p>, <p>Christians of all denominations also believe Germany will be less safe as a result of the migrant surge, with more than three in five saying they believe crime will rise.</p>, <p>In May, Germany\u2019s Interior Minister <a href="/web/20160925143905/http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/05/23/germany-registers-surge-crimes-right-wing-radicals/">published a report</a> showing migrants contributing disproportionately to the country\u2019s crime figures.</p>, <p>If migrants were not considered, crime rates in Germany would have remained roughly static over the previous year. In fact, the country saw an extra 402,741 crimes committed.</p>, <p>Many of these crimes were illegal border crossings, but authorities also recorded the 70 per cent of pickpocketings were by non-Germans, of which 34 per cent were by recent asylum seekers.</p>, <p>Despite, the figures, however, German politicians and establishment media focused on \u201cpolitically-motivated crimes by the far-right\u201d, with Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere telling a news conference: \u201cWe are witnessing a growing and increasingly pronounced readiness to use violence, both by right- and left-wing extremists.\u201d</p>]
