[<p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>Maybe not. He sounds like he wants the police officers in Tulsa and Charlotte to be punished before their cases are adjudicated.</p>, <p class="sh2"><span>SIGN UP</span> FOR OUR NEWSLETTER</p>, <p>\u201cThe last few days a couple of more more guys have been shot and killed in the middle of the street,\u201d Sherman said on Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason these guys [in the NFL] are kneeling and locking arms to bring people together, to make people aware this is not right. It\u2019s not right for people to be killed in the street.\u201d</p>, <p>Speaking of kneeling and interlocking arms, one team with two players doing the former and the other with all players doing the latter play on Sunday. Sherman\u2019s Seattle Seahawks host <em>Time</em> magazine coverboy Colin Kaepernick\u2019s San Francisco 49ers. With shootings of citizens by police in Tusla and Charlotte generating headlines and sparking unrest this week, expect more of the same from these two teams\u2014and perhaps expect something more, too.</p>, <p>\u201cWhen you tell a kid, \u2018When you\u2019re dealing with police, just put your hands up and comply with everything,\u2019 and there\u2019s still a chance of them getting shot and no repercussions for anyone,\u201d Sherman explained. \u201cthat\u2019s an unfortunate time to be living.\u201d</p>, <p>It\u2019s also an unfortunate time when player activists and some in the media eschew due process. Just ask former Ferguson, Missouri, police officer Darren Wilson, who was cleared of all charges in the death of Michael Brown, but the media and activists ruined his life convicting him in the court of public opinion. Evidence in Charlotte points to an ex-con with numerous weapons convictions told to put down a gun at least a dozen times before an African American officer (who played football at Liberty) shot him. Despite activists claiming the suspect held a book and not a gun, police found the man\u2019s DNA and prints on the firearm. Courts of law require a higher evidentiary threshold than the scuttlebutt standard used in the court of public opinion.</p>, <p>Speaking of the court of public opinion, the NFL players better be careful with the national anthem protests. They could turn off some patriotic fans. Lower ratings suggest this has already occurred. And a Yahoo <a href="/web/20161218173015/http://www.breitbart.com/sports/2016/09/21/poll-44-look-to-turn-off-nfl-if-national-anthem-protests-continue/">poll</a> showing 44 percent of respondents willing to turn off the NFL if the protests continue indicates that the ratings could drop if athletes continue to drop for the anthem.</p>]
