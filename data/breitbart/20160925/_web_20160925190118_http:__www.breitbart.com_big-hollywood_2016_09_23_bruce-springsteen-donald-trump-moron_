[<p>Springsteen made the comment in excerpts from an <a href="/web/20160925045006/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bruce-springsteen-calls-donald-trump-a-moron-w441761" target="_blank">interview with <em>Rolling Stone</em></a> published Friday, the day of his 67th birthday.</p>, <p>\u201cThe republic is under siege by a moron, basically. The whole thing is tragic,\u201d the E Street Band leader told the outlet. \u201cWithout overstating it, it\u2019s a tragedy for our democracy. When you start talking about elections being rigged, you\u2019re pushing people beyond democratic governance. And it\u2019s a very, very dangerous thing to do. Once you let those genies out of the bottle, they don\u2019t go back in so easy, if they go back in at all.</p>, <p>Springsteen accused Trump of pushing ideas like \u201cwhite nationalism\u201d and the \u201calt-right movement\u201d into the mainstream, though he appeared to understand the\xa0motivation behind the candidate\u2019s political ascent.</p>, <p>\u201cI believe that there\u2019s a price being paid for not addressing the real cost of the deindustrialization and globalization that has occurred in the United States for the past 35, 40 years and how it\u2019s deeply affected people\u2019s lives and deeply hurt people to where they want someone who says they have a solution,\u201d Springsteen told <em>Rolling Stone</em>.</p>, <p>\u201cAnd Trump\u2019s thing is simple answers to very complex problems. Fallacious answers to very complex problems. And that can be very appealing,\u201d he added.</p>, <p>When interviewer Brian Hiatt asked if the rocker had lost any enthusiasm for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, \u201cthe Boss\u201d replied that he had not.</p>, <p>\u201cI like Hillary. I think she would be a very, very good president.\u201d he said.</p>, <p>Springsteen\u2019s full interview with <em>Rolling Stone</em> appears in the magazine\u2019s upcoming issue.</p>, <p>\xa0</p>, <p><em>Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: <a href="/web/20160925045006/https://twitter.com/dznussbaum" target="_blank">@dznussbaum</a></em></p>]
