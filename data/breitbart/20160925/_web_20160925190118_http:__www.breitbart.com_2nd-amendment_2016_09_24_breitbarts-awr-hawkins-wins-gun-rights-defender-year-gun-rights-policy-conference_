I wake up every day, turn on my computer, and begin emailing my editor about stories I think we need to cover as way to uphold the right to keep and bear arms on the one hand, while exposing the left\u2019s relentless efforts to take away our freedom on the other. I do the same thing every day because the fight does not end, and it was encouraging to have a group like the Second Amendment Foundation recognize those efforts.</p>, <p>Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Alexander Marlow stated,\xa0\u201cDr.Hawkins is a tireless defender of the Constitution. He has made Breitbart.com one of the world\u2019s foremost resources on the topic of guns. And perhaps more importantly, he\u2019s a decent man and a great colleague. It\u2019s nice to see him get the recognition he so richly deserves.\u201d</p>, <p>AWR Hawkins won the \u201c<a href="/web/20160925085108/http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2015/09/27/breitbarts-awr-hawkins-recognized-journalist-year-national-gun-rights-conference/">Journalist of the Year</a>\u201d award at the 30th Annual GRPC in 2015.</p>]
