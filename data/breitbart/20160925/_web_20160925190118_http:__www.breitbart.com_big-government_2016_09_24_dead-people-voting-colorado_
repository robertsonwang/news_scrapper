If there are errors, election officials leave deceased\xa0people registered, leading to fraudulent votes.</p>, <p>Following CBS4\u2019s investigation, the Colorado Secretary of State\u2019s office confirmed that at least 78 dead people are registered to vote.</p>, <p>In May 2016, California found that it had hundreds of <a href="/web/20160925201504/http://www.breitbart.com/california/2016/05/25/report-dead-voters-found-voting-california/">dead voters</a> on its voter rolls, with 215 of them in the Los Angeles County area alone.</p>]
