[<p>The tiny Virginia town of Farmville, home to Longwood University and Tuesday night\u2019s vice presidential debate, prides itself as a <a href="/web/20161005073701/https://www.arborday.org/programs/" target="_blank">\u201cTree City USA\u201d</a> \u2013 the benefits of which, we\u2019re told, include \u201ca framework for action, education, a positive image and citizen pride.\u201d</p>, <p>It\u2019s safe to assume that the evening\u2019s two combatants \u2013 Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence \u2013 walked onto the debate stage hoping to achieve those same goals (especially the part about a positive image).</p>, <p>How\u2019d they do?</p>, <p>Here are five observations.</p>, <p><b>The Tone</b>. The evening started out on a civil tone and it stayed that way, for the most \u2013 even if one of the debaters did his best to instill some southern discomfort into the conversation (more on that in a moment).</p>, <p>Kaine opened the proceedings by praising Hillary Clinton for her smarts and experience and wanting to build \u201ca community of respect\u201d (a bow to <a href="/web/20161005073701/http://wtvr.com/2016/10/04/farmville-civil-rights-history/" target="_blank">the civil rights movement</a>). He then took a dig at Donald Trump.</p>, <p>See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. <a href="/web/20161005073701/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/elections/2016/election-prediction">See Predictions Map \u2192</a></p>, <p>Pence likewise praised his running mate, but didn\u2019t neglect to point out that the public is in a wrong-track mood so why vote for more of the same.</p>, <p>And so it went through the night \u2013 each defending, even extolling their running mates\u2019 virtues.\xa0 \xa0</p>, <p>Granted, most any debate without Trump is going to seem somber. But this one was about as far as you get from an endorphin rush \u2013 nothing resembling Trump-level Fourth of July fireworks. Neither man raised his voice. Even when one candidate attacked the other ticket\u2019s greatest weakness \u2013 Trump\u2019s temperament, Clinton\u2019s trustworthiness \u2013 it lacked the vitriol evident at the first presidential debate.</p>, <p>Remember this calm when Clinton and Trump mix it up again, Sunday evening in St. Louis.</p>, <p><b>Pence</b>. Kaine called his debate foe \u201cTrump\u2019s apprentice.\u201d Truth is, the Indiana governor is more like Trump\u2019s antipode . . . for his calm demeanor and steady explanations of policy and his opponents\u2019 shortcomings.</p>, <p>Pence had a few good lines. For example, this passage when pushing back against Kaine for his propensity for touting economic-recovery numbers: \u201cPeople in Scranton know different. People in Fort Wayne know different.\u201d</p>, <p>For those expecting an aggressive performance or a pound of Democratic flesh, Pence didn\u2019t deliver. He was more guide dog than attack dog \u2013 though he almost bared his fangs just past the one-hour mark, when Kaine kept mentioning Trump\u2019s taxes.</p>, <p>There\u2019s a reason why someone came up with the phrase \u201cMidwest nice.\u201d</p>, <p><b>Kaine</b>. Asked a question about doubts over his running mate\u2019s character, he instead berated Trump\u2019s \u201cselfish\u201d persona. When Pence began to cover the Clinton foreign policy record during her Foggy Bottom tenure, Kaine butted in \u2013 and kept interrupting as the night went on.</p>, <p>Why the rudeness? A tactical choice to keep the mild-mannered Pence off-stride.</p>, <p>Kaine had his talking points at the ready \u2013 too many of them, as Pence kept noting. Give Kaine demerits for too many slangy one-liners \u2013 a Clinton-Kaine \u201cyou\u2019re hired\u201d jobs program, a \u201cyou\u2019re fired\u201d Trump-Pence plan, etc.</p>, <p>And I\u2019d further downgrade Kaine for this blunder: he went through an entire back-and-forth about immigration without taking advantage of his fluency in Spanish. <i>Increible</i>!</p>, <p>Bottom line: a tree doesn\u2019t grow in Kaine-ville. The senator left the positive image in the green room.</p>, <p><b>Quijano</b>. This debate\u2019s moderator, CBS News\u2019 Elaine Quijano, got a yuuuge break in that she was tasked with controlling two candidates described by some as <a href="/web/20161005073701/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/10/04/mike-pence-vs-tim-kaine-can-two-nice-guys-kill-each-other-with-kindness.html" target="_blank">vanilla nice</a>.</p>, <p>Quijano asked solid and straightforward questions: why the presidential nominees are dogged by character questions, how their economic plans will work, what to do about policing and public safety, illegal immigration, how to combat home-grown terrorism, and so forth.</p>, <p>For those of you wagering on the first media-bias moment, it may have come at the 35-minute mark when Quijano pressed Pence on South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, a Republican and African-American, <a href="/web/20161005073701/http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/tim-scott-capitol-racism-senate-225507" target="_blank">being harassed by Capitol Police</a> \u2013 with no pushback against Kaine on Black Lives Matter and violent civil disobedience.</p>, <p>Where I\u2019d further critique Quijano: she also put Pence on the spot for Trump\u2019s immigration plan. Was it my imagination or did Pence get most of the questions directed his way?</p>, <p>Though she did ask both candidates their faith, Quijano didn\u2019t press Kaine <a href="/web/20161005073701/http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/tim-kaine-abortion-predicament-225053" target="_blank">on abortion</a>, which may have been a deal-killer for Barack Obama when he was looking for a running mate in 2008. The topic didn\u2019t come up until 98 minutes into the 105-minute debate. She also whiffed on pressing Pence over <a href="/web/20161005073701/https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=mike+pence+controversial+bill&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" target="_blank">Indiana\u2019s religious-freedom law</a>.</p>, <p>Two debates down, two to go, and I\u2019m still waiting for a tough question hurled the Democrats\u2019 way.</p>, <p><b>What\u2019s Next</b>. It wasn\u2019t the high road to Farmville \u2014at least not so for Kaine, whose strategy was to keep his opponent off-stride and off-message. Rarely did he take a pass on mentioning Trump\u2019s character and temperament, even when it wasn\u2019t his turn to talk (the unofficial Fox News count was 39 Kaine interruption to 19 for Pence). And that\u2019s how it may look for the remaining five weeks: Clinton\u2019s campaign believes it has a lead that Trump can\u2019t overcome. </p>, <p>Look for Hillary to do her best to keep Trump off-balance and out-of-sorts in the remaining two debates.</p>, <p>America\u2019s Civil War came to its conclusion not far from Farmville, at the Appomattox Court House.</p>, <p>In 2016, the uncivil war that is Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton continues with two more clashes \u2013 debates on Oct. 9 and Oct. 19 \u2013 before hostilities cease (we hope) on Election Day.</p>, <p>I give Pence the edge on the night \u2013 but that\u2019s due in large part to Kaine\u2019s acting anything but a Virginia gentleman. Had Pence been more forceful in a few moments and pushed harder on voter dissatisfaction with the economy and the political class, it would have been a bigger night.</p>, <p>Tune in Sunday night, October 9, to see if Trump can trump that.</p>, <p><i></i></p>, <p><i>Bill Whalen is a research fellow at Stanford University's <a href="/web/20161005073701/http://www.hoover.org/" target="_blank">Hoover Institution</a>, where he analyzes California and national politics.
