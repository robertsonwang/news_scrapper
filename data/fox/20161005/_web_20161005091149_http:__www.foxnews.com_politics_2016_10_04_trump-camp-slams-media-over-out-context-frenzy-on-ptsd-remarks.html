[<p>The Donald Trump campaign is firing back at the media over a slew of \u201cout-of-context\u201d reports and headlines asserting the Republican nominee took a swipe at veterans suffering from PTSD by suggesting they aren\u2019t \u201cstrong\u201d and \u201ccan\u2019t handle\u201d the stress of war.</p>, <p>Trump technically said those words during remarks to veterans in Herndon, Va., on Monday. But he did so while addressing how to help veterans suffering post-traumatic stress disorder and prevent military suicides.</p>, <p>"When you talk about the mental health problems, when people come back from war and combat, and they see things that maybe a lot of the folks in this room have seen many times over \u2013 and you're strong and you can handle it \u2013 but a lot of people can't handle it,\u201d Trump said Monday.</p>, <p>He went on to say the country needs more mental health help for veterans and vowed to launch a \u201cvery robust\u201d effort.\xa0</p>, <p>Soon after, <a href="/web/20161005073656/https://www.buzzfeed.com/emaoconnor/trump-ptsd?bftw&amp;utm_term=.rmeyYPPGx#.ddgKYEEPW" target="_blank">BuzzFeed ran a headline</a> that said: \u201cTrump Suggests That Soldiers With PTSD Aren\u2019t \u2018Strong.\u2019\u201d</p>, <p>Many other outlets followed suit. <a href="/web/20161005073656/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/trump-suggests-vets-ptsd-aren-strong-article-1.2815752" target="_blank">The New York Daily News</a> declared: \u201cDonald Trump sparks outrage by suggesting vets with PTSD aren\u2019t \u2018strong\u2019 and \u2018can\u2019t handle it.\u2019\u201d</p>, <p>See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. <a href="/web/20161005073656/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/elections/2016/election-prediction">See Predictions Map \u2192</a></p>, <p>The newspaper reported that, \u201cSome veterans are furious at draft-dodging Donald Trump for suggesting soldiers who develop post-traumatic stress disorder aren't \u2018strong\u2019 and \u2018can't handle it,\u2019 seeing it as the latest in a string of insults toward their military service.\u201d</p>, <p>A <a href="/web/20161005073656/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-veterans-mental-health_us_57f280bbe4b082aad9bc4903" target="_blank">Huffington Post column</a> was headlined: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s Comments On Veteran Suicide Are Exactly Why There\u2019s PTSD Stigma.\u201d The story described it as an \u201cabhorrent comment about mental health\u201d from the GOP nominee.</p>, <p>Some articles cited veterans and veterans\u2019 groups concerned about the tenor of Trump\u2019s remarks, amid comparisons to his infamous and widely criticized dig last year at Sen. John McCain\u2019s time as a prisoner of war.</p>, <p>But others jumped to Trump\u2019s defense, saying his remarks here clearly were taken out of context. The campaign circulated a statement from the Marine staff sergeant who originally asked Trump the question about PTSD.</p>, <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s sickening that anyone would twist Mr. Trump\u2019s comments to me in order to pursue a political agenda,\u201d Chad Robichaux, founder of Mighty Oaks Warrior Programs in California, said in the statement. \u201cI took his comments to be thoughtful and understanding of the struggles many veterans have, and I believe he is committed to helping them.\u201d</p>, <p>Retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, an outspoken Trump booster, said \u201cthe media continues to operate as the propaganda arm of Hillary Clinton as they took Mr. Trump's words out of context in order to deceive voters and veterans -- an appalling act that shows they are willing to go to any length to carry water for their candidate of choice.\u201d</p>, <p>He argued Trump was merely \u201chighlighting the challenges veterans face when returning home after serving their country.\u201d</p>, <p>Veterans of Foreign Wars spokesman Joe Davis also put out a brief statement that seemed to agree with Trump\u2019s premise: "It is true that not everyone can handle traumatic events, be it from war, bad car accidents, violent crime or even surviving a hurricane. Regarding veterans, we need to treat those who need help and research how two people experiencing the same time and place can be impacted so differently."</p>, <p>That didn\u2019t stop Vice President Biden from slamming Trump on CNN.</p>, <p>Speaking Tuesday, Biden called Trump \u201cout of touch\u201d and said: \u201cHis ignorance is so profound."</p>, <p><i></i></p>]
