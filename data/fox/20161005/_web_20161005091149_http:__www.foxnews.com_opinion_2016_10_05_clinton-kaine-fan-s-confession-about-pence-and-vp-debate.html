[<p>As an emphatic Clinton supporter, I\u2019m glad the V.P. debate has historically made little difference.</p>, <p>If anyone was still in doubt as to whether Trump made the right choice in selecting Mike Pence over Chris Christie as his running mate, tonight\u2019s performance should put that to rest.</p>, <p>Mike Pence rocked it.</p>, <p>Pence was everything that Donald Trump should have been at last week\u2019s debate.</p>, <p>First and foremost, he was actually a conservative, which is bound to matter to conservative voters \u2013 if even just for an evening.</p>, <p>He stayed on message throughout, emphasizing the cornerstone issues of Trump\u2019s campaign: change, law and order, economic growth and putting America first.</p>, <p>Pence stayed on message throughout the debate, emphasizing the cornerstone issues of Trump\u2019s campaign: change, law and order, economic growth and putting America first.</p>, <p>See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. <a href="/web/20161005101416/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/elections/2016/election-prediction">See Predictions Map \u2192</a></p>, <p>Pence hammered Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine for representing the status quo -- a critical point when 65 percent of Americans want the country to go in a different direction.</p>, <p>He argued that America is less safe today than when Barack Obama took office and used Hillary Clinton\u2019s record as secretary of state to support it.</p>, <p>He talked about cutting regulations and taxes, making government smaller and unleashing the power of the free market. And he made clear that Trump\u2019s policies are driven by one goal: keeping Americans safe, even if the methods to achieve this may have been criticized.</p>, <p>Most of all, though, Pence didn\u2019t take the bait and Kaine dished out plenty of bait.</p>, <p>He successfully \u2013 more or less \u2013 steered away from engaging on various absurd statements Trump has made.</p>, <p>He was able to turn the discussion to attacking Clinton more than defending Trump, which served him well.</p>, <p>There was never any visible signs of stress or agitation and he allowed Kaine to get flustered as he rushed through many of his attacks.</p>, <p>Indeed, Kaine was unable to make Pence squirm on the issues Pence disagrees with Trump about \u2013 Muslim ban, free trade, his comments about Mexican-American Judge Curiel \u2013 and that surely represents a botched opportunity.</p>, <p>But let me be clear, Kaine did well for himself, too. He highlighted a litany of things that Trump has said or done. And, despite Pence denying that Trump said or did them or simply pivoting away from them, the Democratic base -- and those independents Clinton so badly needs -- will have heard him.</p>, <p>Kaine offered a spirited defense of Clinton and her record \u2013 points that rated well with focus groups throughout the debate.</p>, <p>Pence had no answer to a question about Trump\u2019s slanderous comments about Mexicans, Senator John McCain, former Miss Universe Alicia Muchado or Judge Curiel\xa0 \u2013 all serious issues to American voters, many have now decided that Trump doesn\u2019t have the temperament or qualifications to be president according to polls.</p>, <p>Kaine was extremely thoughtful in his discussion of race, policing in America and abortion rights in particular. Indeed, that conversation was perhaps the most thoughtful of the evening (for both men).</p>, <p>I wish that Kaine has grilled Pence more on his own record. Pence came off as relatively moderate, which he is not. Pence passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act which allowed businesses to discriminate against LGBTQ Americans. He holds some frightening positions that Americans need to be made aware of and hopefully they will be discussed more in the coming days. \xa0</p>, <p>In sum, the fact checkers definitely had a busy night.</p>, <p>In large measure, Pence invented his running mate on Tuesday night, but that doesn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t do a bang up job in this debate.</p>, <p>I\u2019ll end as I began, I\u2019m glad the vice presidential debate has historically made little difference.</p>, <p><i></i></p>, <p><i>Jessica Tarlov, Ph.D., is a political strategist at <a href="/web/20161005101416/http://schoenconsulting.com/" target="_blank">Douglas E.
