[<p>The Hillary Clinton campaign has delayed a planned Florida ad buy on the Weather Channel after facing criticism for targeting voters in the path of Hurricane Matthew.</p>, <p>\u201cWe have requested that stations in Florida delay any of those ads on the Weather Channel until after the storm passes,\u201d spokesman Jesse Ferguson said in a statement Thursday.</p>, <p><a href="/web/20161007123150/http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/hurricane-matthew-2016-clinton-trump-path-229200#ixzz4MJEivBuv" target="_blank">Politico first reported</a>\xa0that the Clinton campaign had planned to spend $63,000 on Weather Channel ads in Florida over a five-day stretch starting Thursday, just as the storm nears the coast.</p>, <p>Politico noted that Donald Trump and other candidates have advertised on the same channel this year. But the bid to capture support from anxious Florida residents in the path of a deadly storm that has triggered mass evacuation orders and is expected to strengthen soon into a destructive Category 4 created a bit of an optics problem.</p>, <p>\u201cIf they\u2019re out being too political at a time when the country has its prayers with the people affected, I think it could backfire,\u201d Rep. Greg Walden, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, told Fox News earlier Thursday, before the delay was announced.</p>, <p>Walden called the ad buy \u201crisky.\u201d</p>, <p>See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. <a href="/web/20161007123150/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/elections/2016/election-prediction">See Predictions Map \u2192</a></p>, <p>Kristy Campbell, an ex-press secretary for former presidential candidate and Florida governor Jeb Bush, was more direct as she reacted to the report on Twitter: \xa0</p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">This is a colossally huge and unforced error by the Clinton camp. Insensitive and will piss off Floridians. <a href="/web/20161007123150/https://t.co/ok2ZYEPn7K">https://t.co/ok2ZYEPn7K</a></p>, <p>Bush also weighed in with a word of caution.</p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">I encourage both presidential campaigns to be sensitive to all affected by Hurricane <a href="/web/20161007123150/https://twitter.com/hashtag/Matthew?src=hash">#Matthew</a> in the coming days. <a href="/web/20161007123150/https://t.co/bmM99VlUqm">https://t.co/bmM99VlUqm</a></p>, <p>The Clinton campaign stressed that the ads make up a small fraction of their swing-state ad buys.</p>, <p>"Earlier in the week we made changes to our TV ad reservations across hundreds of stations in several battleground states including Florida. Less than 1% of those changes included the Weather Channel,\u201d Ferguson said. \xa0</p>, <p><i>Fox News\u2019 Serafin Gomez and Jennifer Griffin contributed to this report.</i></p>, <p><b>\xa0</b></p>, <p><i></i></p>]
