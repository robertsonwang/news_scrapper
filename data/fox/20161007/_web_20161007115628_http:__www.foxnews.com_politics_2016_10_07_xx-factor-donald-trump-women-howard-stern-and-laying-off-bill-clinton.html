[<p>This just in: Donald Trump won\u2019t go after Bill Clinton\u2019s sex scandals at the next debate.</p>, <p>At least, that\u2019s what he told <a href="/web/20161007130127/http://pagesix.com/2016/10/05/trump-i-wont-mention-bill-clintons-past-at-next-debate/" target="_blank">Page Six</a>.</p>, <p>\u201cI want to win this election on my policies for the future, not on Bill Clinton\u2019s past,\u201d Trump emailed the New York Post\u2019s Richard Johnson, who had asked about whether Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey or Juanita Broaddrick might come to Sunday\u2019s debate. \u201cJobs, trade, ending illegal immigration, veteran care, and strengthening our military is what I really want to be talking about.\u201d</p>, <p>It\u2019s fitting that campaign news now breaks on the tabloid\u2019s gossip page. Perhaps Trump was just trying to psych out Hillary Clinton in saying he might raise the former president\u2019s sexual misconduct in St. Louis, having stopped himself from saying something \u201cextremely rough\u201d in the last debate. Or maybe it\u2019s a shift in tactics.\xa0</p>, <p>But it drives home how much of the campaign coverage in this latest stretch has been about Trump and women.</p>, <p>And that, in part, is why we keep hearing about Howard Stern and his many Donald interviews over the years. And those are excerpts the Democrats would love to keep pushing out there.</p>, <p>See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. <a href="/web/20161007130127/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/elections/2016/election-prediction">See Predictions Map \u2192</a></p>, <p>Clinton played the card in the Hofstra debate, saying Trump had referred to women as \u201cpigs\u201d and \u201cdogs\u201d and laying the Alicia Machado trap. (The former Miss Universe, by the way, has stopped talking about Trump and accused him in a statement of \u201cattempting to revive slanders and false accusations about my life, in order to humiliate, intimidate, and unbalance me.\u201d)</p>, <p>And the Clinton camp is giving heavy rotation to an ad that shows the faces of young women looking in the mirror over audio of Trump saying things like \u201cshe ate like a pig\u201d and, from the Stern show, \u201ca flat-chested woman, it\u2019s very hard to be a 10.\u201d</p>, <p>The polls show Hillary with a 20-point lead among female voters, so this is a pivotal question. It\u2019s no accident that Trump is pitching a major child-care proposal, with Ivanka front and center.</p>, <p>The thing about Trump\u2019s Stern interviews\u2014and his locker-room talk at \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d according to the AP\u2014is that he viewed himself as \xa0entertaining people.\xa0</p>, <p>Can some of the comments he made be defended in the context of the 2016 campaign? Of course not. Obviously Trump wouldn\u2019t have made them if he had envisioned a future in politics. Nor would the Clintons have shown up at his wedding.</p>, <p>If you like Trump, you wave this away as a guy doing shtick and someone who promoted women in his business empire. If you can\u2019t stand Trump, you believe these blasts of the past are the unvarnished Trump, a man who discusses women in crude fashion.</p>, <p>Stern has developed into a terrific interviewer of media and musical celebrities at Sirius XM, though even in the \u201990s he chatted up Christie Whitman (who kept her promise to name a New Jersey rest stop after him if she was elected governor). But in the sessions with Trump there was plenty of raunchy talk about women\u2019s bodies and, uh, desirability.</p>, <p>This prompted Virginia Heffernan to unload on both men <a href="/web/20161007130127/http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/10/howard-stern-donald-trump-2016-214322" target="_blank">at Politico</a>:</p>, <p>\u201cStern has long had a devilish talent for lulling guests into a false sense of security\u2014and then luring them into rhetorical traps\u2026</p>, <p>\u201cWhat comes across in old tapes of the show, resurfaced recently by BuzzFeed and other outlets, is that Trump, like many of Stern\u2019s guests, was often the one being played. By nailing him as a buffoon and then\u2014unkindest cut\u2014forcing him to kiss the Howard Stern ring, Stern and his co-anchor, Robin Quivers, created a series of broadcasts that today showcase not just Trump\u2019s misogyny but his ready submission to sharper minds.\u201d</p>, <p>First, Stern wasn\u2019t sandbagging Trump, he was amusing his male-heavy radio audience. And Trump was no neophyte but a guy who regularly made news in New York\u2019s tabloids and, by 1996, owned the Miss Universe pageant.</p>, <p>\u201cA lot of that was done for the purpose of entertainment, there\u2019s nobody that has more respect for women than I do,\u201d Trump told KSNV.</p>, <p>In another twist, Stern went after CNN for running this headline: "Howard Stern says Trump backed Iraq War in 2002"\u2014as if he were disclosing some kind of private conversation.</p>, <p>What Stern had actually done is tell listeners how struck he was when his name came up in the presidential debate. The reason was the much-replayed interview from 2002 in which he asked Trump if he favored invading Iraq and the businessman replied with a lukewarm \u201cI guess so\u201d\u2014now undercutting Trump\u2019s argument that he opposed the war beforehand.\xa0</p>, <p>"I got so upset because, let's face it, tapes from our show featuring Donald Trump have been used in the campaign," Stern said."And the other day I was talking to Robin [Quivers] on the air, and I said to her, 'Yeah, you know it was really surreal sorta laying there in bed watching them mention my name on the debate\u2026 So, then there was a big screaming headline on CNN: 'Howard Stern Now Confirms'\u2026.I said nothing new.\u201d</p>, <p>The question of Trump\u2019s attitude toward women, which famously came up at the first Fox debate, will continue to resonate through Election Day. And this remains an uphill climb for the GOP nominee. But I would say the old Howard Stern interviews and Rosie O\u2019Donnell battles are baked into the cake, and anyone who\u2019s upset by that was already not voting for Trump.</p>, <p><i></i></p>, <p>Howard Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of <a href="/web/20161007130127/http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/media-buzz/index.html">"MediaBuzz"</a> (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).
