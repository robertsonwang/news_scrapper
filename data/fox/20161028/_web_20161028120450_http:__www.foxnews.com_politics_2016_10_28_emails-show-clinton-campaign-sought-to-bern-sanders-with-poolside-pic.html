[<p>John Podesta, the chairman of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, could barely contain himself when a Clinton aide emailed him a picture of a shirtless Bernie Sanders lounging at an exclusive resort on Marta\u2019s Vineyard.</p>, <p>\u201cCan we tweet?\u201d Podesta wrote in a 2015 email, <a href="/web/20161028215347/https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9394" target="_blank">according to a recent Wikileaks dump.</a>\xa0Clinton staffers shared the email, and snarky remarks.</p>, <p>\u201cOmg,\u201d Brian Fallon, Cinton\u2019s press secretary, wrote. \u201cI think we shd (sic) give to NY Post.\u201d</p>, <p>Just days after the campaign caught wind of the picture of Sanders in the shade during a Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee retreat at Martha\u2019s Vineyard, gossip maven Perez Hilton posted the picture on Facebook.</p>, <p>Not known for his political accumen, Hilton stumbled on the perfect caption: \u201cI wonder what @MikeBloomberg would think about this??? @BernieSanders lounges at elite Martha\u2019s Vineyard pool, summer 2015, after helping raise money from Wall Street lobbyists.\u201d</p>, <p>It was not clear if Team Clinton sought to publicize the photo to show Sanders, a champion of the working class, at an exclusive locale or if the goal was to circulate an unflattering picture of a septuagenarian in a swimsuit.</p>, <p>See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. <a href="/web/20161028215347/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/elections/2016/election-prediction">See Predictions Map \u2192</a></p>, <p>In an MSNBC report titled, <a href="/web/20161028215347/http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/bernie-sanders-regular-luxurious-dscc-fundraising-retreats" target="_blank">\u201cBernie Sanders a regular at high-dollar donor retreats,\u201d</a> it was pointed out that Sanders was once even \u201cspotted chatting sociably for close to an hour with a financial services lobbyist who was in a hot tub while the senator sat nearby.\u201d</p>, <p>Through much of the primary, Clinton sought to distance herself from Wall Street. In some of their most heated debates, Sanders appeared to land some punches that tied her to banks.</p>, <p>\u201cI stood up against the behaviors of the banks when I was a senator,\u201d Clinton said during an April debate. \u201cI called them out on their mortgage behavior.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cOh my goodness, they must have been really crushed by this,\u201d Sanders said.</p>, <p>A spokesman for Sanders did not immediately respond to an email from FoxNews.com about the picture. But since losing the nomination fight, Sanders has embraced the Clinton campaign and said \u201cI am determined to implement the agenda of the Democratic Party platform which was agreed upon by her campaign.\u201d</p>, <p>Sanders supporters were not always so forgiving. One commenter replied to the picture on Hilton\u2019s Instagram account, \u201cHillary put you up to that one\u2026lol nice try! Ps I\u2019m glad Hillary can love the gay community for 3 years and that\u2019s enough for you (sic) turn your back on someone who has been fighting for equality for decades.\u201d</p>, <p>Kenneth Corcoran, 61, a machinist in New Hampshire, said this kind of campaigning is what turns him off from national politics. The former Sanders supporter said he is on top of the issues and has followed the WikiLeaks dump and has been unsatisfied with her explanations.</p>, <p>\u201cIf I\u2019m in a particularly foul mood on [election] day, I may vote Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cJust to stick a pen in the Clintons.\u201d \xa0</p>, <p><i></i></p>]
