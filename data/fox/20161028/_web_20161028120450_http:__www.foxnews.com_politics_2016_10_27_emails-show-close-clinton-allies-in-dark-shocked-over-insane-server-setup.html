[<p>Some of Hillary Clinton\u2019s top advisers were in the dark about the scope and depth of her controversial email system as the scandal broke in March 2015, with even her now-campaign manager professing ignorance about the private system at the time, according to emails released Thursday by WikiLeaks.</p>, <p>One close ally, Center for American Progress leader Neera Tanden, was still fuming months later, pressing now-Campaign Chairman John Podesta on who gave Clinton permission to use the system.</p>, <p>"Do we actually know who told Hillary she could use a private email? And has that person been drawn and quartered?" <a href="/web/20161028134537/https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/33895" target="_blank">Tanden wrote</a> in July. \u201cLike whole thing is f---ing insane.\u201d</p>, <p><a href="/web/20161028134537/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/10/25/need-to-clean-this-up-clinton-aide-cried-foul-on-obamas-email-denial.html" target="_blank"><b>CLINTON AIDE CRIED FOUL ON OBAMA'S EMAIL DENIAL</b></a></p>, <p>The tenor of the emails belies the assuring tone Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, and her campaign took as they publicly downplayed the controversy in the months after it broke. The emails showing Hillaryland\u2019s initial reaction to the news were discovered in a batch of more than 33,000 hacked from Podesta\u2019s account and subsequently posted to anti-secrecy site WikiLeaks.</p>, <p>While some of Clinton\u2019s closest aides, particularly those who worked with her at the State Department, such as Cheryl Mills and Huma Abedin, appeared to be well aware and deeply involved in her email setup, others apparently were not.</p>, <p>See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. <a href="/web/20161028134537/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/elections/2016/election-prediction">See Predictions Map \u2192</a></p>, <p>On March 2,\xa0<a href="/web/20161028134537/https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/34370" target="_blank">Podesta wrote</a>\xa0to current Campaign Manager Robby Mook asking if Mook had \u201cany idea of the depth of this story?\u201d</p>, <p>"Nope. We brought up the existence of emails in research this summer but were told that everything was taken care of," Mook wrote back at 1:32 a.m. on March 3.\xa0</p>, <p>Podesta also wrote to Tanden airing his concerns on March 2, the day the story\xa0about Clinton\u2019s private email account broke.</p>, <p>\u201cSpeaking of transparency, our friends [attorney David] Kendall, Cheryl and Phillipe [Reines] sure weren\u2019t forthcoming on the facts here,\u201d Podesta wrote.\xa0</p>, <p>Tanden replied, implying that keeping the email setup a secret was likely Mills\u2019 doing.</p>, <p>\u201cThis is a Cheryl special,\u201d Tanden wrote. \u201cKnow you love her, but this stuff is like her Achilles heel. Or kryptonite. She just can\u2019t say no to this s---. Why didn\u2019t they get this stuff out like 18 months ago? So crazy.\u201d</p>, <p><a href="/web/20161028134537/https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/34176" target="_blank">Tanden added</a>: \u201cI guess I know the answer they wanted to get away with it.\u201d</p>, <p>Six months later, Tanden still appeared upset at Clinton, <a href="/web/20161028134537/https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/33831" target="_blank">writing to Podesta</a> after Clinton gave an interview on Sept. 4 that the former secretary of state still owed the American people an apology.</p>, <p>\u201cEveryone wants her to apologize. And she should,\u201d Tanden wrote in September 2015. \u201cApologies are like her Achilles heel. But she didn\u2019t seem like a b---- in the interview. And she said the word sorry. She will get to a full apology in a few interviews.\u201d</p>, <p><i></i></p>]
