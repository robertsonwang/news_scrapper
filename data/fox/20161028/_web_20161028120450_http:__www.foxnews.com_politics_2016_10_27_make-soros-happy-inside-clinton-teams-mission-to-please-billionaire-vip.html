[<p>Newly revealed emails posted by WikiLeaks show top aides to Hillary Clinton went out of their way to keep a certain VIP happy: Uber-liberal billionaire George Soros.\xa0</p>, <p>The emails, hacked from the account of Clinton Campaign Chairman and Soros ally John Podesta, disclose that Clinton was advised to do fundraisers simply to make Soros \u201chappy.\u201d They also indicate the 85-year-old Hungarian-born heavyweight, through his top aides, freely reached out to Podesta to make Soros\u2019 wishes clear on issues ranging from trade to migration to the Supreme Court.</p>, <p>In one instance, trusted Clinton adviser Huma Abedin wrote to now-Campaign Manager Robby Mook on Oct. 7, 2014, to tell him Clinton was having dinner with Soros. Abedin said she expected Soros would eventually ask Clinton to appear at a fundraiser for America Votes, one of the many liberal organizations Soros helps fund, and Abedin wanted to know how to proceed.</p>, <p>\u201cI would only do this for political reasons (ie to make Soros happy),\u201d Mook replied.</p>, <p><a href="/web/20161028141624/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/08/17/money-talks-from-ferguson-to-unrest-overseas-new-reports-reveal-soros-influence.html" target="_blank"><b>NEW REPORTS REVEAL SOROS INFLUENCE</b></a></p>, <p>During her time as secretary of state, <a href="/web/20161028141624/https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/24651" target="_blank">Clinton was forwarded</a> from Soros\u2019 aides on Jan. 23, 2011 a message he wrote specifically for her addressing \u201ca serious situation\u201d in Albania. Soros even included two actions that \u201cneed to be done urgently.\u201d One of the suggestions was appointing \u201ca mediator such as Carl Bildt, Martti Ahtisaari or Miroslav Lajcak\u2026\u201d</p>, <p>See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. <a href="/web/20161028141624/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/elections/2016/election-prediction">See Predictions Map \u2192</a></p>, <p>Clinton received the email the next day. On Jan. 27, Lajcak met Albanian leaders for a mediation effort.</p>, <p>Just hours after Associate Justice Antonin Scalia was reported dead on Feb. 13, 2016, the president of the Soros-founded Open Society Foundations also emailed Podesta.</p>, <p>\u201cRemember our discussion of Wallace Jefferson, [former] Chief Justice in Texas?\u201d Chris Stone asked cryptically.</p>, <p>Podesta replied: \u201cYup.\u201d</p>, <p>Most of the Soros-related correspondences with Podesta came via Michael Vachon, an adviser and spokesman for Soros, who frequently emailed Podesta to schedule phone calls and meetings and relay his boss\u2019 policy positions. Many of the messages were brief or mysterious. </p>, <p>On Feb. 23, 2015, Vachon wrote to Podesta that he needed to tell him something \u201cseparately, important, timely but certainly not urgent.\u201d In a message dated Jan. 13, 2009, Vachon thanked Podesta for meeting with Soros the previous day.</p>, <p>\u201cHe found it extremely useful,\u201d Vachon wrote.</p>, <p>Other emails show a stream of Soros\u2019 policy beliefs being passed to Podesta: An invitation to the screening of a film about climate change at Soros\u2019 house in July 2015; a short documentary based on Soros\u2019 essays about Ukraine in January 2015; a Soros-authored piece titled \u201cRecapitalize the Banking System\u201d in October 2008.</p>, <p>On March 7, 2016, Vachon sent Podesta a memo regarding \u201cTPP and Malaysia\u2019s Corruption Crisis.\u201d The document criticized President Obama for making \u201cvisible compromises\u201d in his quest to get a deal for the Trans Pacific Partnership completed. Podesta was ostensibly set to discuss the memo with Soros and his son, Alexander, during a dinner later that month. Six days later, Vachon got even more specific.</p>, <p>\u201cIn general I think George is more interested in talking about policy than the campaign per se,\u201d Vachon wrote. \u201cIn a separate email I will send you George\u2019s latest thinking on the migration crisis, which he is spending a lot of time on. His other big preoccupation these days is Ukraine.\u201d</p>, <p>While Vachon said Soros wasn\u2019t interested in discussing \u201cthe campaign per se\u201d at that dinner, his involvement in the 2016 election is extensive. As of July, Soros had donated $25 million to help elect Clinton and other Democrats, <a href="/web/20161028141624/http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/george-soros-democratic-convention-226267" target="_blank">Politico</a> reported.</p>, <p><i></i></p>]
