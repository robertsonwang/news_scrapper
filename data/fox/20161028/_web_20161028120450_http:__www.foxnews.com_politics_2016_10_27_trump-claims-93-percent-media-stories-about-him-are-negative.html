[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump sounded several familiar refrains Thursday, claiming that the media and polls were biased against him while raising questions about opponent Hillary Clinton's health.\xa0</p>, <p>"I think 93 percent of the stories [the media] write are negative," Trump told Fox News' Bill O'Reilly on 'The O'Reilly Factor.' "Even if it\u2019s a positive story, they\u2019ll always find a way to make it negative."</p>, <p>Trump appeared to be <a href="/web/20161028081657/http://newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/rich-noyes/2016/10/25/mrc-study-documenting-tvs-twelve-weeks-trump-bashing" target="_blank">citing a recent study</a> by the Media Research Center, which found that 91 percent of the network news coverage of Trump was devoted to negative stories about the real estate mogul.</p>, <p>"You know I\u2019m not quite used to it, because I used to get great publicity," Trump admitted. "Now, no matter what you do it doesn\u2019t make any difference."</p>, <p>Trump also claimed that NBC had committed an "illegal act" by recording his now-infamous 2005 conversation about women with "Access Hollywood" host Billy Bush. The tape caused a firestorm when it was made public by The Washington Post earlier this month.</p>, <p>"The microphone was not supposed to be on, not that I make that as an excuse for myself," Trump told O'Reilly. "[But] that was a private dressing room - yeah that was certainly illegal, no question about it."</p>, <p>See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. <a href="/web/20161028081657/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/elections/2016/election-prediction">See Predictions Map \u2192</a></p>, <p>Under California law, it is a crime\xa0to record private conversations without the consent of all parties -- as long as the participants have a reasonable expectation that no one is listening.<br/> </p>, <p>The GOP nominee did not say whether he would take action against the network, saying only "You'll see. You'll see."</p>, <p>The billionaire also described Hillary Clinton as "low-energy" while questioning her physical well-being.\xa0</p>, <p>"I saw her after the second debate and she could barely make it to the car," Trump said. "This is not what we want. This is not what we want to negotiate with China, to beat ISIS, to work against Putin.</p>, <p>"Look, there\u2019s something going on and I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening," he added. "She goes away for 3, 4, 5 days and she doesn\u2019t leave the house and then she comes back."</p>, <p><i></i></p>]
