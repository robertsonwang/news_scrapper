[<p>On Tuesday, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk unveiled plans for a spacecraft and rocket project that intends to put intelligent life on Mars: human life.</p>, <p>In a speech at the International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico, Musk announced that SpaceX will develop an interplanetary rocket and capsule designed to move roughly 100 people and their cargo to the red planet.</p>, <p>Musk said it would be a "super-exciting" adventure but also dangerous, at least initially.</p>, <p>Mars is located about 140 million miles from Earth and the journey takes anywhere from six-to-nine months, according to Reuters. Musk said the trek would occur around every 26 months, when the planets are favorably aligned for flight.</p>, <p>Gizmodo <a href="/web/20161004053137/https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__gizmodo.com_this-2Dis-2Dhow-2Delon-2Dmusk-2Dplans-2Dto-2Dbuild-2Da-2Dcity-2Don-2Dmars-2Dup-2D1787146547&amp;d=DQMFaQ&amp;c=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQ&amp;r=bGJCQMlXzr6Qu0fWFCFrXFhq3lg45xqmhILuvuWmb7w&amp;m=D4UBFhxyuji-Pe0hXVcQH1D1C-IReZlflDSiR84Ecb0&amp;s=CUFkKsKAvzkyNBmLgxOnl6neMbBGHKZvnfOc_mTLmPw&amp;e=" target="_blank">noted </a>that Musk estimated a ticket runs about $10 billion per person right now, and he outlined four ways to make the ticket price hover between $100,000-$200,000. \u201cThe four ways include using reusable rockets; refueling the spaceship in space, and by using a methane fuel instead of traditional rocket fuels,\u201d wrote Gizmodo. \u201cMost excitingly, that methane fuel could be harvested on Mars itself.\u201d</p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">Future Mars mission departing from historic Pad 39A at Kennedy Space Center <a href="/web/20161004053137/https://t.co/kCtBLPbSg8">https://t.co/kCtBLPbSg8</a> <a href="/web/20161004053137/https://t.co/Zvk4BNybee">pic.twitter.com/Zvk4BNybee</a></p>, <p>SpaceX\u2019s first mission to Mars will be supported by NASA with a 2018 expected launch date.
